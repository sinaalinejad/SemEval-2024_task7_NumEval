He also shot and injured another woman in an attempted carjacking later. The suspect is identified as 45-year-old Shareef Allman. The San Jose Mercury News says he moonlighted as producer of a show called Real 2 Real on something called CreaTV in the area. (He interviews Jesse Jackson in one YouTube clip, which is in the gallery. Allman, who spread a message of non-violence, also has written a book called Amazing Grace about female victims of domestic violence, notes the Mercury News. The shooting spree occurred about 4:30am local time when a man left a safety meeting at the Lehigh Southwest Cement Permanente Plant, then returned with a rifle and a handgun, according to police. He fled on foot, and a massive manhunt is under way in the San Jose area. Schools are on lockdown, notes AP.",

But there are also some big differences, notes the New York Times, which compares the tech boom of 1999 with that of 2010. For instance, many more people use the Internet now, around 2 billion, compared to less than 250 million 11 years before. And there isn't such an onslaught of tech IPOs: 308 in 1999, about half of all the IPOs in America that year, compared to just 20 last year. Most importantly, this new crop of tech start-ups has actual business models this time around. Groupon has been profitable since 2009 and Facebook's revenues continue to grow.  In those days, you had tiny, little companies going public that hardly had a business plan,  said a finance professor at Stanford University.  And now you\u2019re talking about only a few companies\u2014companies that are already global and with revenue.  And with a group so select, things won't go as badly if the bubble bursts, say some investors.",

        "news": "(May 1, 2017  9:52 AM CDT) Marla Dixon was a 19-year-old mother-to-be who had gotten her prenatal care from the federally funded Jessie Trice Community Health Center in Miami. Nurses and midwives met with her along the way, and before giving birth to son Earl Reese-Thornton Jr. on Dec. 2, 2013, things had been progressing well. The birth, she alleged in a lawsuit, was disastrous. Earl Jr. had to be revived after entering the world and suffered permanent severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The judge agreed Dr. Ata Atogho was at fault, with the verdict noting he left her room for extended spells, once to speak to his stockbroker for eight minutes; with fetal heart rate monitors indicating the baby was in severe distress, the doctor also should have performed a C-section but didn't. The $33.8 million Dixon and her child will receive as a result won't cost Atogho a penny. That's because he wasn't the one being sued; rather, the US government was, as it's liable for any injuries its medical employees cause, explains the Miami Herald. Not only does Dixon say Atogho never apologized, she also says he lied, something backed up by the testimony of a nurse who noted Atogho wrote  refused c/s  [that's C-section] in Dixon's medical records; on the contrary, the nurse testified she yelled,  Just cut me.  Local 10 reports the judge in his order cited a defense expert who says the child will live only nine to 12 more years. Though the head of Jessie Trice says Atogho is no longer connected to its centers, he has not been reprimanded and his Florida medical license is currently  clear and active.  This in spite of three other teen moms who have sued over babies delivered by Atogho in 2013 who ended up brain damaged or disabled. (This woman sued her doctor after becoming pregnant when she thought she couldn't.)",

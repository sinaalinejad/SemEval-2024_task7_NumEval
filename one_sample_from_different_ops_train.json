        "news": "(Oct 7, 2014  12:40 PM CDT) As of Jan. 1, Walmart will no longer offer 30,000 of its employees health insurance. Bloomberg notes that's about 2% of its workforce. The move comes as a reaction to the company's rising health care costs as far more of its employees and their families enrolled in its health care plans than it had expected following the ObamaCare rollout. The AP reports those costs will surge $500 million this fiscal year, $170 million more than had been estimated. Those affected are employees who average fewer than 30 hours of work per week; the Wall Street Journal explains they were grandfathered in when Walmart in 2012 stopped offering insurance to new hires who didn't exceed the 30-hour threshold. A benefits expert says Walmart is actually late to the game in terms of cutting insurance to some part-time workers; Target, the Home Depot, and others have already done so. Meanwhile, Walmart's full time workers will see their premiums rise in 2015. Premiums for the basic plan, which 40% of its workforce is on, will increase 19% to $21.90 per pay period come Jan. 1.",

Today brought a new tweet:  A few words from my heart on oscarpistorius.com.  There, the double-amputee Olympian posted a brief statement. It reads in part:  No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident  that  consumes me with sorrow. The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.  Meanwhile, Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, released a statement of their own.  All we are looking for is closure and to know that our daughter did not suffer on that tragic Valentine's Day,  they said, per the Guardian. Steenkamp's uncle noted a private family gathering would be held today in Cape Town to mark the anniversary.  We will release balloons in her memory,  he told the AFP.  They will be red and white, her favorite colors.  Steenkamp's parents also said a foundation, possibly focusing on women's abuse issues, would be set up in their daughter's honor once Pistorius' murder trial is over. It begins March 3.",

That's what a new report from the European Parliament's Greens/European Free Alliance group is accusing Ikea of, to the tune of $1.1 billion, per CNNMoney. The report alleges that the retail giant funneled money from its stores in highly taxed countries around Europe through a Dutch subsidiary, and possibly also through Luxembourg and Lichtenstein, so it could reap significant tax savings, notes Reuters. This type of  profit shifting \u2014in which headquarters for multinational companies are set up in low-taxed nations\u2014is common in Europe, CNN notes. Ikea's response, via a statement:  We pay our taxes in full compliance with national and international tax rules and regulations.  The European Commission says it's going to delve more into the supposed tax avoidance, which Reuters notes is alleged to have taken place over a six-year period.

The Senate today cleared the bill, 62-36. Northeast lawmakers say the money is desperately needed to help recovery efforts from the one of the region's worst storms. The House passed the bill two weeks ago. The measure is aimed primarily at helping residents and businesses as well as state and local governments rebuild from the Oct. 29 storm. It passed despite opposition from fiscal conservatives worried about adding to deficits. Sandy roared up the East Coast and has been blamed for more than 130 deaths and billions of dollars in residential and business property damage. The biggest chunk of money is $16 billion for Housing and Urban Development Department community development block grants. Of that, about $12 billion will be shared among Sandy victims as well as those from other federally declared disasters in 2011-2013. Obama has said he will sign the bill.",

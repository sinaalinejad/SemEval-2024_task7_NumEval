Scott Walker did an about-face yesterday and demoted the son of a major campaign donor from his $81,500-per-year Commerce Department gig\u2014to his former $64,728 job. Brian Deschane will return to his previous post as a bureau director at the Department of Regulation and Licensing, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports. The 27-year-old, who has no college degree and little experience (but does have two drunk-driving convictions!), had been in that job just two months when he was promoted to head of Wisconsin's environmental and regulatory affairs. Among those Deschane beat out for the job: a former Cabinet secretary with a doctoral degree and eight years experience overseeing oil contamination cleanup, and a professional engineer who had held the job since 2003 under the last governor. Neither was even interviewed.  When Governor Walker learned the details of this agency staffing decision, he directed his administration to move in another direction,  a Walker spokesman says (last week, this same rep called Deschane a  natural fit  for the position). But the demotion didn't satisfy some Democrats.  I want to make sure he was properly hired for that job in the first place,  said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca.

That after a diabetic former employee won a lawsuit connected to the juice. Linda Atkins was working at a Maryville, Tenn., location in the fall of 2011 when she felt a hypoglycemic attack coming on. The main cashier was on break, and so  to avoid leaving the cash register unattended, and for the security of the store,  Atkins grabbed a bottle of OJ from the cooler, drank it, and then paid for it once her blood sugar had stabilized. WBIR reports the same thing happened again the following January. She was fired for  grazing,  and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued. On Sept. 16 Atkins was awarded $27,565 in back wages and $250,000 in compensatory damages, per an EEOC press release. The backstory is that Atkins asked her supervisor if she could keep her own juice at the register but was told that violated store policy\u2014except that policy allows exceptions for people with medical needs. Atkins' firing was precipitated by a March 2012  shrinkage  audit to investigate any employee thefts at the store; two employees who admitted to  grazing  pointed out that Atkins had done it as well. That's when Atkins was fired, though the auditors were aware of the medical angle and that she had ultimately paid for the drinks. While the jury found Atkins was wrongfully fired and that the Americans With Disabilities Act was violated, it didn't find the managers acted with malicious intent, thus there are no punitive damages, reports the Knoxville News Sentinel.

Those  unrelenting  calls, which were typically automated calls that left the same recorded message, would take place up to five times a day, even after the Coniglios had an attorney send letters asking Bank of America to quit it. That refusal to restrain the robocalls is why the Tampa judge who ruled in this case tripled the initial recompense from $500 per call to $1,500, WTSP notes. BofA wouldn't comment initially, but late yesterday it sent a statement to ABC saying the calls were to help the Coniglios prevent foreclosure, not to harass them for money owed.  Because our calls were not answered and our efforts to help the Coniglios \u2026 were urgent, these calls continued,  the statement says.

He's even come up with the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, which is included in his recently released book, The Sting of the Wild. The index runs from one to four; the aforementioned wasp's sting comes in at a four, and Schmidt likens it, per NPR, to this scenario:  A running hair dryer has just been dropped into your bubble bath.  Compare that with the mud dauber wasp, whose sting is akin to  jalapeno cheese when you were expecting Havarti ; it registers as a one, to the common honeybee's two. In addition to providing colorful, connoisseur-grade descriptions of the pain caused by stings, the Sting of the Wild provides all sorts of information about stinging insects. For instance, stingers evolved from the tubes through which eggs are laid, ovipositors, so only female insects can sting. Male insects fake it, Schmidt tells National Geographic, by  curling their abdomen around and jamming it into you,  in hopes you'll let them go. Butterflies, moths, and other insects that don't sting don't need to, another entomologist tells National Geographic. They lay their eggs on the surface of plants, in a process that doesn't require an ovipositor, hence, no stinger. When asked whether he wants to be stung, Schmidt tells NPR,  Want is kind of a dual word. I want the data, but I don't want the sting.

Housing costs remain the greatest child-rearing expense, as they did when the reports started in the 1960s, although current-day costs like childcare were negligible back then. For middle-income families, the USDA found, housing expenses made up roughly 30% of the total cost of raising a child. Child care and education were the second-largest expenses, at 18%, followed by food at 16%. Expenses per child decrease when a family has more children, the report found, as families with three or more children spend 22% less per child than families with two children.

After a 10-month investigation, eight felony counts of continual sexual abuse and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child were filed yesterday against Robert Pimentel of Newport Beach for abuse that allegedly took place at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary. Pimentel, 57, left his fourth-grade teaching position last March when allegations arose from several girls who told their parents he inappropriately touched them and police opened an investigation. District officials immediately removed him from campus, but before the official dismissal process could begin, Pimentel, who had worked for the district since 1974, retired. Pimentel is suspected of inappropriately touching the children over and under their clothing; the allegations cover a period between September 2011 and March 2012. He is also suspected of the sexual abuse of one adult.",

The girls were found dead, each shot by a shotgun, beside a dirt road in Marysville hours after they were reported missing, per the AP. Doris had been sexually assaulted and semen was collected from her body. However, it was only sent for testing in March 2014 by an investigator who  had a bit of free time and really looked very closely at this case,  Sheriff Steve Durfor tells the AP. The semen matched DNA samples taken from Patterson and Harbour during previous arrests, police say.

Harbour, who has felony drug convictions, was also arrested Tuesday in the girls' hometown of Olivehurst, Calif. The men were 22 at the time of the murders.

Jack Lowe and Dennis Reynolds were two of them, and their DNA didn't match that taken from the poop, which had been found in the aisles and on canned goods. So they sued. Courthouse News Service reports that they cited the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which  generally prohibits  a company from asking its workers to hand over their genetic info. Last month, US District Judge Amy Totenberg determined Atlas did indeed seek and obtain such info as outlined by GINA, even though the test didn't disclose any medical details. She denied Atlas' motion for summary judgement, and the New York Times spoke to legal experts who believed this to be the only case involving GINA to go to trial. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the men were on Monday handed a total of $475,000 in compensatory damages for pain and suffering and $1.75 million in punitive damages; GINA has a $600,000 cap on such damages, however, meaning the amount could ultimately be reduced.

That's the conclusion of a small new study that was a restaging of a previous one. As Science Direct explains, in 1938 an ad in a British paper invited Bolton Evening News readers to respond to the question,  What is happiness?  The 226 respondents were then asked to organize 10 factors by their happiness importance. Their top three, in order: security, knowledge, and religion. Last year, psychologist Sandie McHugh also asked Bolton residents, via the News, to fill out a questionnaire that mirrored the one used in 1938. Some 76 years later, things have certainly changed, at least according to the 489 people the News reports responded to the survey: Religion now occupies the 10th slot. While security holds on to a place in the top 3, it is joined by leisure and good humor, which the survey defined as  more smiling and laughter for myself and those around me.  McHugh observes that  the overall impression from the correspondence in 1938 is that happiness factors were rooted in everyday lives at home and within the community,  and that, too, has changed: While a majority once reported being happiest in their town, 63% of 2014 respondents said they were happier away from Bolton. What hasn't changed: more leadership and more politics ranked near the bottom in both years. (Click to read about an equation for happiness, or find out the world's happiest country.)",

The Australian study was a big one, based on assessments of the health of 200,000 people over four years; the men and women are part of the southern hemisphere's biggest longitudinal study on aging, the release notes.  We found that smokers have around threefold the risk of premature death of those who have never smoked,  says researcher Emily Banks.  We also found smokers will die an estimated 10 years earlier than non-smokers.  That was true for both men and women, Banks says, as the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The two-thirds figure supports similar results from the UK and US. The average smoker in the study kept up the habit for 38.5 years, and the majority smoked at least 15 cigarettes daily. That's particularly worrying given that mortality rates were about twice as high  in those smoking around 10 cigarettes per day.  A pack a day means death rates fourfold or fivefold what a nonsmoker experiences, the study finds.  Our findings are an important reminder that the war on tobacco is not yet won, and tobacco control efforts must go on,  Banks notes. Looking on the bright side, the study shows  it's never too late to quit, no matter what your age or how much you smoke,  says another expert, as HealthDay News reports. (Another recent study finds that smoking kills more people than we thought.)",

That's $460 per day for an average of 12,287 prisoners, and it's quite a bit higher than what other big cities spend: $47,063 a year in LA ($128.94 a day), $52,925 a year in Chicago ($145 a day). Why? Experts say Rikers Island is a big part of the reason; the 400-acre island costs hundreds of millions per year to run. The city's former correction commissioner says costs would come way down if Rikers was replaced with jails next door to courthouses ($30.3 million is spent each year on transportation alone), but no one wants to go that route.

We want these guys put away out of public view.  Another problem: New York inmates sometimes wait years in city jails before going to trial. Last year, the average length of a stay for detainees was 53 days. For sentenced inmates, 38.6 days. And one last interesting note: Costs are going up even though incarceration rates are going down.

Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world,  is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,  says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company  pursued [a] profit-driven strategy  with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, that's enabled the company to avoid paying $59.2 billion in US taxes. Pfizer has some $193 billion abroad, per the Post. The new report singling out Gilead, the Post points out, highlights the  simmering battle  between President Obama and big business over the practice of sending assets to foreign countries.",

They're among more than 130 state prison escapees nationwide who are listed as on the loose, the AP found in a coast-to-coast survey. Most have been gone for decades, meaning the chances of finding them have dwindled dramatically\u2014that is, if they're even alive. The AP asked all states for a current total of escapees from secure, locked state prisons where they were held full time.

After six months, a fugitive's trail generally goes pretty cold, says the head of the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents. Some states regularly revisit escape cases, keep an eye on vanished prisoners' associates, and check fingerprint databases and death certificates for new leads.

That means they are either in denial or they are incompetent, because there is no way that at 41% of our campuses there were no sexual assaults over the past five years,  she said after the report was released yesterday. Others are only investigating a fraction of the assaults they report to the Education Department\u2014as few as one in seven in some cases.

Sarah Leah Whitson, the group's Middle East director, said  regardless of the crimes allegedly committed, executing prisoners in mass only further stains Saudi Arabia's troubling human rights record.  She said al-Nimr was convicted in an  unfair  trial and that his execution  is only adding to the existing sectarian discord and unrest.  Before his arrest in 2012, al-Nimr had spoken out against the killing of protesters and other injustices. His nephew Ali, who was arrested when he was 17 is also facing execution, but his name was not among those listed Saturday.

The State Department offered $25 million, with two air travel associations adding an additional $1 million each. So did anyone collect? Annie Lowrey explains on Slate that there's no way of knowing, but it appears unlikely. The State Department normally likes to boast when it doles out rewards so that more people will be encouraged to turn criminals in. But this time, NPR notes, Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the matter. And we already know many of the key tips came from detainees, none of whom would receive a payout. The rewards program has worked well, proving to be integral to the captures of Saddam Hussein's sons and the 1993 World Trade Center bomber, among others. A spokesperson confirms that bin Laden's reward is no longer available since he's dead, but she would not say whether anyone snagged the reward or a portion of it. Someone might still be in the running for it\u2014perhaps a wary local suspicious of bin Laden's $1 million compound\u2014but from what we know so far, Lowrey writes, it appears  this time the United States got the bad guy the old-fashioned way.",

Researchers surveyed 38,000 adults aged 20 and older, then estimated that 59% of Americans took prescription drugs as of 2012, compared to 51% in 1999. They also found those on five or more medications rose from 8% to 15%, reports Newsweek. Why the jump? Scientists note the 65-and-older population is growing, with 40% of those in this group taking five or more meds. However, the number of people taking at least five meds rose across all ages. Researchers say part of the reason is likely obesity, noting eight of the 10 most commonly used drugs treat conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes, per the Washington Post. There's also better screening and diagnosis, but the possibility of medications being overprescribed remains, reports Time. Researchers say the use of drugs to treat high blood pressure jumped from 20% to 27%, while the use of statins, which lower cholesterol, rose from 2% to almost 8%. The most commonly used drug, taken by 8% of Americans, was simvastatin, which lowers cholesterol and the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The use of antidepressants also grew from 7% to 13%, a change scientists link to  shifting attitudes regarding depression,  while the use of narcotics rose 2%. Still, some prescription drugs are being used less. The use of antibiotics fell 1.5% from 1999 to 2012, while hormone drug use dropped 8% after a study found menopausal hormone therapy increased a woman's risk for heart disease and some cancers.

Researchers believe the cats lived in human settlements and were tolerated because of their ability to catch rats and mice, though the remains of an older cat show that its diet was heavy in grain, raising the  possibility that this cat was unable to hunt and scavenged for discarded human food or that it was looked after and fed by people.  One puzzle for researchers: Today's domestic cats are all descended from a single subspecies of Middle Eastern wildcat but the Chinese village was a long way outside its range, suggesting ancient traders imported the cats as novelties or even food, the Los Angeles Times reports.",

Though the FBI didn't actually upload illicit content to the site, the FBI also didn't attempt to hide 9,000 downloadable images and videos and links to thousands more.

But not everyone is thrilled with how the sting went down. A lawyer for one of the men arrested, a former middle school teacher, likened the move to  flooding a neighborhood with heroin in the hope of snatching an assortment of low-level drug users,  in a court filing requesting charges be dropped. It's not the first time the FBI has used such a ploy. In 2012, it took control of three child porn sites and kept them online to try to identify users.

A child aged about one and half years rescued alive at 0400 hours,  the organization tweeted, adding in a press release that the baby had been found 80 hours after the collapse nestled in a bucket and wrapped in a blanket. Although the child, IDed as Dealeryn Saisi Wasike by the BBC (which also says she's only 6 months old), seemed dehydrated, there were no other immediate signs of injury, and she's now recuperating at a nearby hospital. The Red Cross' Twitter feed also indicates the baby has been reunited with her dad, though the group says it hasn't confirmed what happened to her mother, per Reuters. Media reports differ, but estimates hover at around 140 rescued so far and almost 100 still missing after the six-story building slated for demolition in the Huruma district crumbled after heavy rains Friday. At least five people are due in court Tuesday to face manslaughter charges, including a city inspection official, a rep from the nation's construction agency, the building's engineer, and two brothers who own the site. The owners didn't have permission to rent the building out, and it was apparently never approved by the city. That last point doesn't appear to be an anomaly: Nairobi's deputy governor tells Nairobi News that up to 70% of residential buildings don't have formal approval from City Hall.

The restaurant doors were damaged and restaurant manager Kevin Romero tells the Pueblo Chieftain that the thief broke through padlocks on a restaurant freezer to get to the cheese, which is worth around $1,900. Nothing else was taken. Per a police report, clues left at the scene included a crowbar and other  biological evidence.  Romero says this is at least the third time cheese has been stolen from the restaurant, presumably to be sold to other eateries, in the last month and a half. However, this time the thief's image was captured by security cameras the restaurant recently installed.  The first time they came in they stole about probably five or six boxes,  Romero tells KOAA about the increasingly brazen crimes.  The second time was eight to 10 boxes, and now the 19 boxes.

Vester tells Variety that when Brokaw was the host of NBC Nightly News, he made unwanted advances and tried to forcibly kiss her on two occasions, telling her he was looking  for an affair of more than passing affection.  She says Brokaw, who is 30 years her senior, turned up uninvited at her hotel room in 1994, when she was 28, and at her residence in London the next year. Vester, a former war correspondent, says the behavior of her married colleague was  coercive and disgusting.  This is the first time Brokaw has been publicly accused of sexual harassment. Vester says she didn't report Brokaw's misconduct because there is a culture at NBC  where women who raise questions about misconduct get labeled as troublemakers  and she feared for her job, having just been hired full-time. Brokaw, who has been married to Meredith Auld since 1962, says he met with Vester twice at her request because she wanted career advice.  The meetings were brief, cordial, and appropriate, and despite Linda\u2019s allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her, at that time or any other,  he said in a statement issued by NBC. The Washington Post reports that Brokaw also denies a second accusation of sexual harassment, from a woman who says he behaved inappropriately with her when she was a young production assistant at NBC in the mid-1990s.",

This CEO-to-worker retirement gap is a lot bigger than the pay gap and one more indicator of the extreme level of inequality that is really tearing the country apart,  the report\u2019s co-author tells Bloomberg. CNBC reports employer-sponsored retirement plans are disappearing. And according to Bloomberg, a number of the 100 CEOs with the largest retirement accounts head companies that have cut retirement benefits for employees. CNBC reports those 100 CEOs will average a monthly check of $277,686 in retirement. Meanwhile only 18% of private-sector employees even have access to a pension plan. According to Bloomberg, the CEO of Yum! Brands has the cushiest nest egg with $234.2 million in retirement savings. That's 3,300 times larger than the 401(k) of one of his employees\u2014if they even have one (just a fraction do, per regulatory filings). Many of these CEO retirement accounts are so large because they're allowed to defer an unlimited amount of their salary tax-free. But regular employees are capped at around $20,000 per year into their 401(k)s.  These benefits weren\u2019t originally intended to be huge wealth generators, but they\u2019ve become that as CEO compensation has grown to 200 to 300 times what average workers make,  one expert tells Bloomberg.

A new study\u2014based on  reconstructions  of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges\u2014finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, reports USA Today.  We can say with 95% probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,  the lead author tells the Washington Post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100\u2014if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which  is hypothesized to be already underway.  There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say. If not for humans, sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal  nuisance  floods in the US would have been avoided, according to Climate Central.

Cyanide poisoning is rare, killing just seven people in the US in 2012\u2014which is why it's especially strange that five days after Ferrante's conviction, another doctor at the hospital where Klein worked also died of cyanide poisoning. Nicole Kotchey, 35, was found unconscious near her desk at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on the morning of Nov. 12 and died less than four hours later, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Now, investigators are trying to determine whether her death was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident, the Guardian reports.  To have one\u2014let alone two\u2014is extraordinarily unusual,  says the Allegheny County chief medical examiner, who adds that he doesn't know why his office would perform such an obscure test for cyanide on Kotchey, but assumes it was because of what happened to Klein. In fact, Klein's colleagues were initially stumped by her sudden and mysterious illness, which lasted three days before she died; they finally  ordered everything including the kitchen sink,  the medical examiner says,  and the cyanide test was part of that kitchen sink.  In her case, Ferrante ordered the chemical and gave it to his wife in a drink he said would help her conceive, but investigators are stumped as to what happened to Kotchey, a molecular biologist. It is possible to ingest, inhale, or absorb via skin a lethal amount of cyanide, but a molecular biology professor says people who work with cyanide are  obviously very aware of its risks \u2014and it's not even clear whether Kotchey did work with cyanide. Cyanide purchases are scrutinized, the professor adds, so investigators are likely looking to see if anyone has purchased it recently. Click for more on Klein's murder.

The company made the announcement in a blog post, noting the $827,659.49 will be split evenly, so each charity will receive $82,765.95. Now here's the fun part: Reddit users will help choose which charities get a check. The rules are designed to  reduce any potential shenanigans : Anyone with a Reddit account before 10am PST yesterday (the announcement came at 10:01) can vote a single time per charity, but for as many charities as he or she would like. Redditors can look up charities via the Charity Navigator database then vote on Reddit's donate page. Voting wraps up Wednesday. Mashable points out Reddit's $8.3 million in ad revenue is rather measly compared to BuzzFeed's earnings; that site passed the $100 million mark in 2014. (Per similarwb.com, Reddit gets more traffic than Buzzfeed.) The discrepancy is probably due, at least in part, to Reddit's tiny banner ads. Electronic Frontier Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, NPR, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Internet Archive were the most discussed charities on Reddit yesterday, CNNMoney reported, and they remain that way today.

The 7-by-5-foot space Hanna dug started with a ceiling 40 inches high. Warmth and humidity from their bodies made the ceiling sag to within 8 inches of their faces. Besides hypothermia, hunger, and a shortage of oxygen, the experienced outdoor enthusiasts had to stave off claustrophobia.  The closer that ceiling got, the more unnerving it was,  Neyman says. Luckily, their ordeal ended a few hours later. A locator beacon led an Alaska Air National Guard helicopter to the shelter, and the crew swooped in and dug out the pair after four nights on Harding Icefield, including three in the cave. Neyman, 36, and Hanna, 46, had planned to spend April 8 cross-country skiing on the 700-square-mile ice field. Then the weather turned. They said their first inclination was to ski down one of the ice field's 30 glaciers, but by nightfall, with visibility at 10 feet, Neyman said she couldn't go on. They spent the night in their tent as a blizzard moved in. At one point, Hanna sent text messages to his 18- and 22-year-old daughters, saying he loved them and was proud to be their dad. Then, figuring their only hope of survival was a snow cave, he set about making one with his hands and a ski. He created a 7-foot, 30-inch-diameter tunnel, then dug horizontally to create the snow cave. They scrambled inside with sleeping bags, pads, a stove, and food. The stove wouldn't stay lit. They made an air hole with a broken tent pole, tying an orange space blanket to it as a signal for rescuers. It worked. By luck, their phone battery held out just long enough for a signal to be picked up. Click for the full story.",

Meanwhile, in his own opinion, Thomas wrote 10 times that amount, per BuzzFeed.

Thomas says Sanger's birth control arguments could also apply to abortion, though conceding she didn't push abortion as a eugenics method:  Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability,  he wrote.

Wilson, both academics from Stanford University, have won the Nobel Prize in Economics and will split the $1.1 million prize for  improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats.  Technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the award was established in 1969 and is now widely considered one of the Nobel prizes. The winners were announced Monday in Stockholm, capping a week of Nobel Prizes at a time when much of the world is experiencing the worst recession since World War II because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the AP reports. The discoveries of Milgrom and Wilson  have benefited sellers, buyers, and taxpayers around the world,  the prize committee said in a statement, per NBC News. In auction theory, researchers undertake a complicated analysis to try to figure out what the outcomes will be in an environment with differing bidding rules. Wilson is being recognized for his development of auction theory involving objects with a  common value \u2014a value that's  uncertain beforehand but, in the end, is the same for everyone,  such as the future value of minerals in a particular area. Using this theory, he illustrated why bidders afraid of the  winner's curse \u2014paying too much\u2014will tend to bid less than what they think the common value is. Milgrom developed auction theory that also involved  private values,  which differ among bidders. He showed that when bidders know more about other bidders' estimated values, the seller tends to receive higher expected revenue. NBC notes that, of the 84 winners of the Nobel in Economics since its inception, only two have been women.",

That's up from an average $26,600 in 2011, and the rise can be blamed on rising tuition fees combined with stagnant family incomes. The struggling economy is a  double-edged sword in many ways because (students) and their parents have fewer resources to pay for college costs, which may lead them to take on more debt,  the institute's research director tells USA Today.  And then they're entering a down economy where it's hard to find a good job that allows them to repay the debt.  A recent study found that parents now cover an average 27% of college costs, down from 37% just three years ago.

But instead of being the first to find the $2 million haul of jewels believed to be buried somewhere in New Mexico, he ended up being its first victim. Police confirmed Tuesday that the remains of the 54-year-old grandfather from Colorado, who disappeared in January, were discovered along the Rio Grande west of Santa Fe by a US Army Corps of Engineers crew working in the area, the AP reports. Bilyeu, who quit his job in 2014 to search for the treasure, told a friend in early January that he had finally figured out its location, 5280.com reported in an in-depth look at the disappearance earlier this month. But Fenn, who says the clues to the location are in a cryptic poem in his 2010 memoir, says the treasure is in the Rocky Mountains, not Frijoles Canyon, where Bilyeu thought the treasure chest could be found. Bilyeu was reported missing on Jan. 14, more than a week after he bought a raft and set out on his final search. His raft and dog were found the day after he was reported missing, but searchers, including family members, treasure hunters, and the 85-year-old Fenn, who chartered a helicopter to search the river for three days, could find no other trace of him.

As part of an agreement reached in 2011 and ratified in June, 162 pockets of land belonging to one country but surrounded by another\u2014111 Indian plots in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi parcels in India\u2014hoisted new national flags on July 31, reports the Wall Street Journal.

While neither option is necessarily convenient, the Washington Post gave a hypothetical that shows just how inconvenient the previous situation could be. Someone living in an enclave might technically need a visa to enter the country that surrounds their land, but getting that visa would require passing through the other country so they could get the visa from a major city in their homeland. And then there was the third-order Indian enclave of Dahala Khagrabari\u2014the only one of its kind in the world\u2014which was enclosed within a Bangladeshi enclave, which was framed by an Indian enclave, which was surrounded by Bangladesh. Most enclaves also had little administration or infrastructure; one man describes sneaking past border guards to get to school.

They arrived at the figure after identifying 533,329 patients who received at least one donated organ between Sept. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 2012. They then compared that group to another 579,506 patients who were put on an organ waiting list but didn't receive one to determine the transplants' effect on lifespan, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to their calculations, people who had kidney transplants lived 1,372,969 extra years, liver recipients lived 465,296 extra years, and heart recipients lived 269,715 extra years. An average of 4.3 years were added to a life per transplant. In terms of specific surgeries, heart transplants gave patients an extra 4.9 years on average, while pancreas recipients averaged 2.6 extra years. The study shows many surgeries, including kidney transplants, are actually  lifesaving,  rather than  life-enhancing,  experts say. However, as 52% of those who needed organs went without over those 25 years,  organ donation must increase  in order  to do even more good for humankind in the future,  researchers say, per Medical Daily.

Plus bacon, sausages, mushrooms, chips, onion rings, black pudding, tomatoes, and beans.

A manager of the Portishead cafe tells the Post that since being launched earlier this month, five people have ordered it and none have finished. Quirky side note: No one under 18 is allowed to order it. The cafe's Facebook page has photos of those who have made the attempt, along with a message to those who have accused it of being wasteful.

Visit his GlacierWorks site and you'll be able to zoom in on it in amazing fashion, seeing  not only the tents, but the little climbers  near Camp 3, explains Breashears. His impetus for creating the image wasn't just to please gawkers a few continents away, but to demonstrate climate change's effect on the mountain. Compared to 20th-century shots of the mountain,  we see a lot less ice. We see less snow cover. We see much more exposed rock in nearly all of the places we visited.  In the NPR interview, Melissa Block poses an interesting question:  I wonder if there is some risk in making these pictures, these images that make the mountain seem so approachable.

About as many North Koreans have defected to the South since the end of 2007 as the number who had fled over the entire previous period since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice: The overall total stands now at 20,050. A ministry official said the rise in defections reflects the worsening economy in North Korea, which has relied on outside food aid since natural disasters and mismanagement wrecked its economy in the mid-1990s, when an estimated 2 million people died of famine. The North's economic troubles are thought to have worsened following a botched attempt at currency reform last year. Most defectors reach South Korea after crossing over a shared border with China, where activists say tens of thousands of North Koreans are hiding.",

According to a report released Thursday, more than 84,000 routine inspections of more than 48,500 pools, hot tubs, and water parks in 2013 across five states turned up at least one violation 79% of the time. Approximately 12% of the time, the violation was serious enough to close the pool. The most common violations were problems with the pool's pH level, safety equipment, and concentration of disinfectants, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to the Washington Post, the problems were worst with kiddie pools, which had to be closed following approximately 20% of their inspections. These violations can have serious health repercussions. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people had to be treated for issues related to pool chemicals between 2003 and 2012, according to the CDC. There were approximately 650 outbreaks of infections or diseases related to pools reported to the CDC between 1978 and 2012.  The findings of this report underscore the need to improve the operation and maintenance of US public aquatic facilities to prevent illness and injury,  the Times quotes Thursday's report. The CDC recommends pool users bring their own test strips to measure a pool's pH and disinfectant levels before swimming.

As recently as 2013, slightly more than eight out of 10 had coverage. Whether the new number from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index turns out to be a high-water mark for President Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all US residents covered, remains to be seen. The law's future is still up in the air and will hinge on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The Gallup-Healthways survey found that the share of adults who lack insurance dropped to 11.9% for the first three months of this year, the lowest level since that survey began its tracking in 2008. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got underway, according to Gallup.  The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,  says the research director for the poll.

A criminal complaint unsealed Thursday accuses Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, 23, of Sacramento, of traveling to Syria to fight in the civil war there and of lying to investigators about it. US Attorney Benjamin Wagner said in a statement that while Al-Jayab was potentially dangerous, there's no indication that he planned any attacks in the United States.  According to the allegations in the complaint, the defendant traveled to Syria to take up arms with terrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities,  Wagner said. Meanwhile, the US Attorney's Office based in Houston said late Thursday that Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan, 24, of Houston, was indicted Wednesday on three charges of trying to provide material support to extremists. Both men are Palestinians born in Iraq, authorities say. There is no indication from prosecutors that Al Hardan was a threat in the United States, but his arrest sparked immediate criticism of the Obama administration's refugee policies from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Federal officials say three separate arrests in Milwaukee on Thursday grew out of the Sacramento investigation but aren't related to national security.",

A bridge is deemed fracture critical when it doesn't have redundant protections and is at risk of collapse if a single, vital component fails; it's structurally deficient when it is in need of rehabilitation or replacement because at least one major component of the span has advanced deterioration or other problems that lead inspectors to deem its condition poor or worse. Of those, 7,795 were both structurally deficient and fracture critical\u2014a combination of red flags that experts say indicate significant disrepair and similar risk of collapse. The AP looked at those bridges, which carry more than 29 million drivers a day. They're located in all 50 states (among them: New York's Brooklyn Bridge) and many were built more than 60 years ago. Cities and states would like to replace the aging and vulnerable bridges, but few have the money; nationally, it is a multibillion-dollar problem. Of course, engineers and officials say the bridges are safe, but the Interstate 5 bridge in Washington state that collapsed in May was fracture critical and the Minneapolis bridge that collapsed in 2007 was structurally deficient.

Meanwhile the state could spend roughly the same money\u2014and possibly much less\u2014on an AC system that would satisfy a federal judge's order to protect death row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. This tally, based on state documents provided in response to the AP's public records requests, is the first public accounting of how much the case has cost taxpayers. Most of the money has gone to private attorneys on opposing sides of the case, which US District Judge Brian Jackson says could ultimately cost many more millions of dollars, and expert witnesses and state contractors also have received tens of thousands of dollars. More than two years have passed since Jackson ruled Louisiana imposes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment once the heat index exceeds 88 degrees. The index routinely crosses that threshold on death row, occasionally exceeding 100 degrees; plaintiff James Magee said it's like a  sauna  in the morning and an  oven  in the afternoon. A plaintiffs' expert estimated it would cost about $225,000\u2014sans engineering fees or operating costs\u2014to install AC on death row's six tiers. A state engineer in 2014 said nine AC units could cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that holds death row, with a state attorney saying each unit would cost  several thousand dollars.  State attorneys argue installing AC would spawn more suits from prisoners nationwide demanding cooler cells. Jackson is set to hear testimony Wednesday on whether the state's current heat remediation measures\u2014one cold shower a day, ice chests in the cells, and fans outside\u2014are adequately protecting the plaintiffs as Louisiana's sweltering summer approaches.",

One of his colleagues said the image was Blackwood's idea, but he had apologized and removed it after angry complaints. The judge, however, said Blackwood  intentionally plotted to insult religious belief,  though it was  unreasonable only to blame the foreigner,  reports the AFP. Blackwood tells the BBC he is  disappointed  with the verdict and plans to appeal.

These men expressed contrition for what they said was a mistake, but meanwhile extremists like Wirathu have incited violence in the name of Buddhism,  he tells Reuters.

But before she died, the Guardian reports, Natasha Chin, 41, rang an alarm bell in her cell for about two-and-a-half hours with no response from the staff at Bronzefield prison. Chin had been released in April, but was reportedly recalled to prison earlier this month. It is believed she was taking the medication to help her recuperate following a major surgery. Sodexo, which receives more than $84,000 per year per inmate to run the prison, confirmed that the death occurred and called it a  tragedy . But it would not say if Chin had been designated an  at risk  inmate. For observers in England, Chin's death serves to highlight mounting problems within the country's prison system.  Too many prisoners are dying in custody,  academic and former inmate Alex Cavendish tells the Guardian.  A significant proportion of these deaths might have been avoided if appropriate care, including mental health support, had been in place and proper assessment procedures followed.  According to a report released this year, prison assaults in 2015 were up 27% over the year before; incidents of self-harm were up 24%. There's  a simple and unpalatable truth about far too many of our prisons,  the country's chief prison inspector tells the BBC.  They have become unacceptably violent and dangerous places.  Earlier this year, per the Independent, Bronzefield prison came under fire for distributing tents and sleeping bags to inmates being released, rather than arranging for housing.

Researchers have for the first time discovered direct evidence of the water, which exists as a fourth form: not liquid, not ice, not vapor, but hydrogen and oxygen molecules trapped in a mineral called ringwoodite found in the transition zone, which sits between the upper and lower mantles, USA Today reports. Their findings follow up on the discovery, announced in March, of a water-rich sample of ringwoodite from the transition zone that was brought to the surface via a Brazilian volcano. That find  showed us at least one place there is water, but it didn't tell us how expansive the water would be,  explains Steve Jacobsen, one of the lead researchers. By analyzing how seismic waves moved at various depths, they found that  water is everywhere beneath North America,  New Scientist reports. To measure all of the United States took eight years, and the team wants to next determine whether the water-rich minerals extend around the whole planet, though doing so is reliant on the availability of seismometers in other regions.  Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades,  Jacobsen says, according to the Guardian; its existence was first theorized in 1987. The discovery could change our understanding of how the oceans formed: While some scientists have theorized the oceans' water came from a comet or asteroid, these findings suggest the oceans actually hail from water deep inside the planet that oozed out of rocks and was driven to the surface by geological activity in Earth's early days. The underground  reservoir  could hold three-quarters of the Earth's water. (Click for more on the ringwoodite found in a  hell diamond  in Brazil.)",

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences says the invention is just 20 years old,  but it has already contributed to create white light in an entirely new manner to the benefit of us all.  The laureates triggered a transformation of lighting technology when they produced bright blue light from semiconductors in the 1990s, something scientists had struggled with for decades.

The bank's report, which analyzed the careers of 5 million workers over four decades, found that it's the first 10 years of a person's time in the labor market that likely determine lifetime earnings, the Washington Post reports. Fatih Guvenen, one of the report's authors, explains that entry-level workers start off at lower pay while they absorb new skills; once the learning curve is overcome, employers start to pony up more in their paychecks. But on average, that increase starts to fall flat after the initial spurt, with most of the growth taking place within those first 10 years\u2014which may mean, as Akane Otani points out on Bloomberg, that  unless you're a fantastic anomaly, you'll probably see your last big raise well before you celebrate your 40th birthday.  Workers set to take in the median lifetime amount will see a 38% pay boost from age 25 to 55, but most of that growth happens between 25 and 35. Meanwhile, workers in the 95th percentile for earnings will experience a 230% earnings growth from age 25 to 55, while the top 1% (our doctors, lawyers, and so forth) will reap a 1,450% growth in the same period. The group that suffers most? The bottom fifth of earners, who suffer income declines in that same bracket due to often physically demanding jobs.  Low-skilled jobs tend to use brawn, not brain,  Guvenen says, as per the Post.  Brawn depreciates very quickly.  A snippet of schadenfreude, as pointed out by Bloomberg: The more money an individual makes now, the researchers say,  the more room he has to fall and the less room he has left to move up.",

The film, funded by a nonprofit group, features images including Muslim terrorists shooting Christians and a doctored photo of the White House flying an Islamic flag, as a narrator says that Islam's  true agenda  in America is to  infiltrate and dominate  the country. Reports first came out a year ago that the department had used it during training; at that time, a top police official said it had only been screened by a few officers. A FOIA request, however, shows otherwise. The title of the film refers to three jihads: the first during Muhammad's time, the second during the Middle Ages, and the third happening today in the West.  Americans are being told that many of the mainstream Muslim groups are also moderate,  says the narrator, a Muslim himself.

The numbers, based on 2011 data, do fluctuate based on the model: Prius owners were slightly more likely to stick with a gas-electric ride, with 41% selecting another hybrid; for Honda hybrid owners, that number sunk to less than 20%, reports MSNBC. The fact that most people own a car for six years could be a contributing factor: It takes seven to 10 years for most hybrid owners to see savings over comparable conventional vehicles. And MSNBC notes that more fuel-sipping non-hybrids are hitting the market, including diesel rides and Hyundais that get more than 40mpg on the highway.",

Why such an abundance? Mainly because being in San Francisco is just as exorbitant for the erstwhile as it is for the alive and kicking. Burials were halted in San Francisco in 1900 for a number of reasons, the main one being that cemeteries  sat on prime real estate,  as the Times puts it. Cemeteries fell into disrepair and became vandalism targets after the ban.  Entire skeletons were carried away to be used as Halloween decorations,  and skulls were reportedly used for soccer games, a local historian tells KQED. So the city went even further in 1912: It uprooted 150,000 already-buried bodies and moved them to Colma graveyards. Some of the disinterred were put back into private plots in Colma if their families ponied up a small fee; others were simply placed in mass graves, including one that reportedly holds nearly 40,000 Catholics at the Holy Cross cemetery.

But animal advocates say the wolf population, only recently taken off the federal endangered list, is too fragile for a hunt.

As of 2011, just 22,909, reports the Verge, which asks the million-dollar question: Why did 27,000 rivers vanish? The answer is an easy one, a census director tells the South China Morning Post: That 50,000 figure was arrived at using topographical maps as many as 60 years old, which were incomplete. The Post cited climate change and water and soil loss as well, but the Verge reports that China itself may have had a heavier hand in the decrease. It spoke with Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, who agreed that the answers offered by the government likely played a role; but he cited pollution and overpopulation as key factors. As the Verge explains, the destruction caused by flooding in the 1960s led the country to erect dams and reservoirs that reined in flooding but messed with the ecological system, causing rivers to go dry. Add in a more than fivefold surge in water use by a booming population in about the same period, along with pollution that only compounds the problem: It's  destroying the limited clean resources we have,  Ma said.",

The company plans to close 175 of its stores in North America over the next few years, most of them by the end of January. That's around a quarter of its stores, not counting outlet stores, and analysts say it's part of a trend for major brands to reduce mall locations.  Your biggest competitor used to be your neighbor in the mall,  a retail analyst at Nomura tells USA Today, but  right now your biggest competitor is the infinite number of random start-up websites. You just don't need as many [brick-and-mortar] locations.  Gap also plans to axe around 250 corporate jobs. An analyst at Merchant Forecast tells USA Today that while  increasing the scarcity  of Gap stores may help, there's no  major creative design force behind the collection  since Danish Creative Director Rebekka Bay was fired in January and the position was eliminated.

But in newly unsealed affidavits, police outline a theory of what might have happened to the Lyon sisters, the Washington Post reports. Sheila, 12, and Katherine, 10, disappeared after a visit to a mall in 1975. The affidavits suggest they were kidnapped from the mall before at least one of them was sexually assaulted. Both were then murdered and their bodies were left on a mountainside, according to the documents. They note that a person of interest in the case, convicted sex offender Lloyd Welch, then 18, said years later that he departed the mall  in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared.  Welch emerged in the case long ago when, shortly after the disappearance, he told mall security he'd seen a man leave with the girls in a car, the AP reports. In a 1998 interview\u2014during which Welch was in prison after having pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a different 10-year-old girl\u2014Welch linked his uncle, Richard Welch, now 69, to the kidnapping, the affidavits say.

After Lloyd was dropped off at home, the others remained in the car; the following day, the younger man saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the sisters at the uncle's home, he said. He added that he left and  never saw the Lyon sisters again,  note the affidavits. The juvenile family member who Lloyd Welch said was in the car, however, now tells the Post he wasn't, and that he doesn't believe his uncle was connected to the disappearance.  If Lloyd did this, I hope he fries for it,  says Thomas Welch Jr. Richard's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury in the case in December.",

In an effort to preserve its good mojo abroad, the motorcycle maker on Monday announced that within 18 months it will be producing EU-sold bikes outside of the US. The move is a reaction to the 31% tariff the EU put in place on Friday, which was itself the first phase of retaliation against new US tariffs on steel and aluminum. CNNMoney reports the tariff had previously been 6%. The company said the new figure would jack up the cost of a motorcycle by $2,200, and it's unwilling to pass that increase on to its EU consumers, who purchased roughly 40,000 bikes in 2017\u2014a six-year high. That made the EU its second-biggest source of revenue last year, per the AP. Harley-Davidson will swallow the increase until the production has moved; it expects that to be as much as a $45 million hit this year.

CNN notes that Broadbent rejected the president's lawyers' claims that he wasn't on the hook for the fees because he never signed the NDA; Broadbent found that since Trump reimbursed his fixer Michael Cohen $130,000 in hush money, he was party to the NDA.",

A court in Brussels has ordered the 84-year-old retired monarch to pay Bo\u00ebl for each day he refuses to provide the court-ordered sample based on Bo\u00ebl's claim that Albert, then the prince of Li\u00e8ge, had a decades-long affair with her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, which resulted in her birth in the 1960s, reports the BBC.

Albert has denied that Bo\u00ebl is his daughter ever since she went public with the claim in 2005, 12 years after Albert ascended to the throne after the death of his brother, Baudouin. Albert abdicated in 2013, and his son, Philippe, in 2013, is now king. Albert had appealed a 2018 court order requiring him to get the DNA test, and that appeal was struck down as part of Thursday's ruling, per the Brussels Times and Reuters.

I expected to see a fairly steep decline, but I did not anticipate it would be this large,  study coauthor Serge Wich tells the Guardian.  You think the numbers can\u2019t be that high, but unfortunately they are.  Coauthor Maria Voigt agrees, telling NPR the number of orangutans lost is  much higher than people had anticipated.  It's estimated there are only 70,000 to 100,000 Bornean orangutans left\u2014the orangutan species is found only on the island of Borneo\u2014and only half the remaining 64 orangutan populations on the island contain enough members to have a viable future. Part of the problem is habitat loss. Borneo has the worst deforestation rate in the world, with approximately 865,000 acres of forest lost to development every year between 2001 and 2016. Researchers estimate another 45,000 orangutans could be lost in the next 35 years from deforestation alone. But Voigt says hunting of orangutans is  at least a major driver if not the major driver  for their decline. They're killed for food or when they wander onto plantations; mothers are killed to sell their babies as pets.  We know this decline has been largely due to hunting, and if we can turn that around, these orangutans could, over a long period, bounce back,  Wich tells the Guardian. The world's other two species of orangutans\u2014both found in Indonesia\u2014have fewer than 15,000 or so members combined. (A recent study found great apes may be able to  read minds. )",

A federal judge agrees in the case of Michael Cohen, approving on Friday a 90-day stay in the civil lawsuit against him and President Trump by Stephanie Clifford (aka porn star Stormy Daniels), the Washington Post reports. The reasoning: Trump's personal lawyer filed a declaration this week noting he intends to plead the Fifth in the Daniels case, as he fears answering questions in that matter could potentially implicate himself in the criminal probe against him in New York, per NPR. FBI agents working on the latter investigation carried out a raid on Cohen's home and office in early April, and because part of that mission was to seek documents related to Daniels' nondisclosure agreement, there may be  large potential factual overlap  with Daniels' civil case, per Otero.  This is no simple criminal investigation,  Otero noted Friday.  Whether or not an indictment is forthcoming, and the Court thinks it likely based on these facts alone, these unique circumstances counsel in favor of stay.  Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, responded to Otero's ruling on Twitter, tweeting:  While we certainly respect Judge Otero's 90 day stay order based on Mr. Cohen's pleading of the 5th, we do not agree with it. We will likely be filing an immediate appeal to the Ninth Circuit early next week. Justice delayed is justice denied.  He added to the New York Times that  we want to get the truth to the American people as quickly as possible.  The Post, however, notes it's not unusual for those facing both civil and criminal issues to do exactly what Cohen's doing to avoid incrimination.

Her tracker first placed her off the coast of New Jersey's Atlantic City, then near Myrtle Beach, SC, in mid-October before she was pinged in the Florida Keys on Saturday. The tracker placed her heading toward the Gulf side of Florida as of Monday. OCEARCH says the creature, which measures 15 feet, 5 inches, is the second largest great white shark it's ever tagged in the northwest Atlantic. The nonprofit has teamed up with SeaWorld to follow great whites in the hopes of finding out more about their eating and breeding habits, and it's hoping Unama'ki will bring them right to a major site.  As a big mature female, Unama'ki has the potential to lead us to the site where she gives birth and [expose] a new white shark nursery,  OCEARCH says.

After that attack, the city commissioned a report on its dog problem, which has found that about 8,700 canines are roaming its southernmost streets, forcing residents to venture outside only with pepper spray or weapons like baseball bats, the Los Angeles Times reports. The strays are mainly in the poorer areas of the city, where mostly blacks and Latinos live, and where the issue is exacerbated by a lack of veterinary facilities for spaying and neutering, pups abandoned by evicted residents, and people from other areas dumping their own unwanted dogs there.  It's a huge problem,  Councilman Casey Thomas says.  People walking with sticks and golf clubs? That's a quality-of-life issue.  The Boston Consulting Group report found loose dogs of all sizes and breeds, noting that 85% of the dogs in South Dallas aren't spayed or neutered, and that bites from strays in the city went up 23% between 2013 and 2015. The city manager is mulling several options, including upping enforcement and offering cheaper spaying and neutering, per WFAA. But a rep for the Street Dog Project nonprofit tells the Morning News it's  extremely rare  for residents to bump into truly vicious dogs: She says that although the dogs her group has rescued are jumpy, they're  fine  once they find a home. Residents who attended a town hall meeting about the issue Monday\u2014with a stray dog loitering in the parking lot, per NBC Dallas\u2014might disagree.

It also says it shipped 5.7 million pills to two pharmacies in nearby Kermit, home to 400 people, between 2005 and 2011. In 2008 alone, Miami-Luken provided the equivalent of 14 pills a day for every Kermit resident, including children, while Illinois-based drug wholesaler HD Smith supplied 3,000 hydrocodone tablets a day to a pharmacy in a town with 1,800 people, records show.

Andrew Cuomo announced the results of the tests Thursday, in which 3,000 people at grocery stores and other shopping sites in 19 counties were checked for antibodies, CNBC reports. The tests showed 13.9% overall had them, which would translate to possibly 2.7 million people in the state. The highest infection rate was in New York City, at more than 21%. Cuomo had said the FDA-approved test would give officials the  first true snapshot  of how widespread the disease is. Having the antibodies doesn't mean a person has immunity; the World Health Organization said last week that the tests don't indicate whether a person is now safe from COVID-19. If New York's results are indicative of infection rates, it would mean the number of cases is far higher than officials had thought; 250,000 cases in the state have been confirmed. But Cuomo said it would also mean that the fatality rate is as low as about 0.5%, per the New York Times. The sample wasn't completely random, Cuomo conceded, which makes drawing firm conclusions difficult. People out shopping could be exposed to the virus more than people at home, but then, they evidently were healthy enough to be out shopping.  What does it mean? I don't know,  the governor said Thursday. New York City's disease official warned that the tests can give false positive results\u2014or false negative ones.

A Brooklyn woman felt a cold coming on ahead of her vacation and went to the doctor to make sure it wasn't strep. She had a routine throat swab, gave a blood sample, and left with a prescription for antibiotics. The resulting bill: $28,395.50. Insurer Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota covered $25,865.24, and the doctor's office waived patient Alexa Kasdan's portion of the remainder. Still, Kasdan is complaining about the system that produced such a bill, and NPR digs in for possible explanations. For one thing, the tests ordered were elaborate and, in the eyes of an outside doctor, unnecessary.  In my 20 years of being a doctor, I've never ordered any of these tests,  she says. Also, the tests were sent to a lab outside of Kasdan's insurance network. And Finally, the lab in question, Manhattan Gastroenterology, appears to be affiliated with Kasdan's physician, Dr. Roya Fathollahi, because they share phone numbers and addresses. Fathollahi declined to comment, though her office told Kasdan that nothing was out of the ordinary about the tests or the bill.

A second officer, Alberto Gonzalez, then shot Bell Jr. in the head as the young man's family watched from 10 feet away, reports the Kenosha News.

According to the private investigator Bell hired, Bell Jr. didn't have the gun (his mother and sister say they tried to alert police that he didn't): Their working theory is that Strausbaugh's gun holster got caught by the car mirror, and he mistakenly thought the pull he felt was Bell Jr. reaching for his gun.

Cerro Gordo, a 300-acre town nestled in the Inyo Mountains not far from Death Valley, has a  Wild West  history thanks to the discovery of silver there in 1865; within four years, mining operations made it the largest producer of silver and lead in the state, and it later became the largest producer of zinc carbonates in the entire country. But that era ended, and by 1950, Cerro Gordo was basically abandoned. The previous owners, brothers who inherited the town from their family\u2014the property listing says the town had been owned by the same family for decades\u2014decided to sell it while attempting to keep its history intact, and received a dozen serious offers after announcing the sale in June.

The entrepreneurs' plan is to revive the town, developing it into a destination while preserving its history. There are nearly two dozen buildings on the property, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, including a church and theater, a general store, a museum, a two-story hotel, an eight-bed bunkhouse, and of course a saloon; in addition to its iconic swinging doors and two pianos, the saloon features a bloodstain underneath three bullet holes on one wall.

The New York Times reports on the financial mess the elite Kirov Academy of Ballet in Washington, DC, finds itself in: As the paper puts it, the school is  recovering from one of the bigger embezzlement scandals in the history of ballet,  and it allegedly got there by hiring Sophia Kim as comptroller. She had experience with the school, having been its treasurer about 20 years prior. But in period between then and her mid-2017 rehiring, she had done time for embezzling $800,000 from a nonprofit tied to Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. The school was also affiliated with the church during Kim's first go-round; today it's not, though one of Moon's daughters remains board president. In November Kim was arrested for allegedly misappropriating $1,501,283.13 from the academy. She has not yet entered a plea. An FBI affidavit claims Kim cashed checks written to herself and used the debit card she was given to make 120 cash withdrawals over 9 months in 2018. NBC Washington cites court filings that say no one else at the school had use of the debit card. Some of the money allegedly went to pay off gambling debts at the MGM Grand Casino in Maryland. But the Times describes a situation that's not so straightforward: It recounts how Moon's love of ballet was sparked\u2014in part by the dancer who agreed to marry the  spirit  of Moon's 17-year-old son after he died in a car accident, all so the teen could gain access to heaven, per church teaching\u2014and shares the church's belief that Kim was actually looking out for the church when all that money vanished the first time.

The bad news is that the 85-year-old suspect died three days before detectives obtained an arrest warrant for first-degree murder on Friday. Duke J. Pierson died of natural causes in Covington County, Ala., on Jan. 22, roughly 10 months after he denied wrongdoing in an interview with investigators, reports KOMO News. Nonetheless, detectives believe Pierson killed 31-year-old Dorothy Fielding, a female coworker with whom he was rumored to be having an affair. Cigarette butts were found in her car ashtray after she vanished in August 1967, though she didn't smoke, and Pierson did. Eight months later, her body was discovered in her supermarket uniform in a shallow grave in an off-road park near Spokane. A few years after that, the body of a Fielding acquaintance who disappeared in June 1967 was found in a shallow grave in the same park, just 1.8 miles away from where Fielding was buried, per KREM. But until a tip arrived last April, detectives had no idea that Fielding knew 47-year-old Ruby Lampson; both women were known to frequent the same tavern. Detectives now suspect Pierson is to blame for both of their deaths and that of his wife. In the month following Fielding's disappearance, 33-year-old Sandra Pierson was found dead in her exhaust-filled car in the couple's closed garage in what was reported as a suicide, though her children believe she was too small to close the  heavy and possibly malfunctioning garage door  on her own, per KOMO.

It was odd: The 64-year-old was healthy; there were abrasions on his neck; and the door, which could be locked from either side, was indeed locked, though he had been home alone. The police thought the death seemed  natural  and not suspicious. An exam of his body showed a fractured sternum. But the autopsy determined that while he had no heart issues, an  acute cardiac arrhythmia  caused his death. Twelve months later, Bridget would be dead, too. She was found at the bottom of the stairs. Though this death was considered suspicious, authorities also thought the 63-year-old could have fallen, though her position\u2014face up with her head on the last step\u2014was unusual.

Three recalls released Thursday by the government add new problems and vehicles to the Korean automakers' list of safety woes, which have brought hundreds of complaints about fires from across the nation. The companies have now recalled nearly 2.4 million vehicles for fire and engine failure problems since September of 2015, and they are under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for potentially being slow to fix faulty vehicles. In addition, the companies are doing a  product improvement campaign  covering another 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures and send the cars into a reduced-speed  limp  mode if problems are detected. The largest of three recalls posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website Thursday covers nearly 379,000 Kia Soul small SUVs from 2012 through 2016 with 1.6-liter engines. Documents show that high exhaust gas temperatures can damage the catalytic converters, which control pollution. That can cause abnormal combustion and damage pistons and connecting rods. A failed connecting rod can pierce the engine block and cause oil leaks that can cause fires. In addition, Hyundai and Kia are recalling 152,000 Tuscon SUVs from 2011 to 2013 and Sportage SUVs from 2011 and 2012 to fix an engine oil pan leak that also can cause fires. Documents in the latest round of recalls don't mention whether there have been any fires or injuries. The director of the Center for Auto Safety has said more than 300 fire complaints to NHTSA have come from across the country, including a death in Ohio in April of 2017. (More details here.)",

The 410,451 deaths by Jan. 1 are expected under the most likely scenario offered by the model, which assumes current restrictions remain the same. Under a worst-case scenario, in which mask usage stays at current rates but social distancing requirements continue to be relaxed in favor of herd immunity, US deaths could top 620,000, per USA Today and CNN. An additional 100,000 deaths over the next four months, for a total of 288,381, is seen as the best-case scenario, requiring near-universal mask use, per the Hill. The most likely scenario predicts 2.8 million global deaths by the end of the year.

The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman,  The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.  The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002. As for the story behind the man who felt comfortable paying so much for a nip of Scotch, he's a 36-year-old writer of online fantasy novels who reportedly made $16.8 million in 2015.

Now research out of the Andean highlands of South America suggests the humans who braved such conditions more than 7,000 years ago did so in an impressive manner\u2014year-round. As a press release explains, prior research established the presence of hunter-gatherers in the higher elevations of southern Peru as many as 9,000 years ago, but there was much debate over whether their occupation was seasonal or permanent. A team led by University of Wyoming researchers set out to answer the question by excavating a Peruvian site 12,500 feet above sea level. That's more than twice as high as Denver, notes USA Today, and so high that lead researcher Randy Haas says he's seen people faint after deplaning at the regional airport there. The team uncovered the remains of 16 people along with some 80,000 artifacts and then looked at these factors: oxygen and carbon isotopes in the human bones, the demographics of those bones, the travel distance to low-elevation zones, and the makeup of the uncovered tools. The results constitute the  strongest empirical support to date for permanent occupation  there, per the study, published in the Royal Society Open Science: the bones revealed low oxygen and high carbon isotope values,  revealing the distinct signature  of permanent occupation; the travel time to a low-elevation zone was too long to be undertaken seasonally; that women and children were part of the group made a low-elevation migration even unlikelier; and their tools were almost exclusively made with stones found at high-elevations.",

A person  briefed on the matter  tells Bloomberg that three of the suspects are thought to be in Russia, while the fourth was being sought for arrest in Canada. Charges that shed light on what an ex-FBI special agent tells the Post is the  murky world of Russian intel services  are said to include hacking, economic espionage, trade secret theft, and wire fraud. Per the Post, this would be the first time Russian government officials have had US cybercrimes charges filed against them. What irks US officials most is that the FSB employees implicated in this case work for a division within the agency that's akin to the FBI's own cybercrime unit, which one official tells the Post is  pretty sad.  If any of the suspects are indeed in Russia, there's no extradition treaty that the US can tap into to haul them to the States, but the Post notes charges such as these, plus possible sanctions, can still wield a  deterrent effect  against future criminality (and the suspects can still get busted if they visit countries that will ship them to the US).

Reporting in the journal PLOS One, they say that French noblewoman Louise de Quengo, who died at the age of 65 in 1656, was buried in France with her husband's actual heart atop her coffin, the organ placed in a heart-shaped lead urn. Toussaint de Perrien had been buried 125 miles away seven years earlier. The ritual, perhaps designed to allow  couples to be reunited in death,  is a  phenomenon that had until now not been noted.  Louise de Quengo's heart was also missing from her body, but neither it nor her husband's burial site have been located. National Geographic explains that while it wasn't unheard of for French aristocrats to have specific body parts buried in separate locations out of political or religious concerns, there's no record of this being done with a romantic intention. Researchers discovered de Quengo while studying bodies from a convent in Rennes in Brittany that had been the premier burial spot for the city's elite, reports Live Science.

Investigators boarded the Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 in the Galapagos Marine Reserve on Aug. 13 and found 300 tons of marine species on board, including 6,600 dead sharks, reports NPR. The reserve has  the highest abundance of sharks known in the world,  per National Geographic, but Quartz notes the vessel was likely only transporting the haul as it did not have the necessary equipment to catch such large quantities of silky, thresher, mako, and what are believed to be endangered hammerhead sharks. It's possible the sharks were brought aboard in unauthorized transshipments along the vessel's route to the Galapagos. But a marine ecologist at the reserve suspects they were fished nearby  based on the trajectory of the boat  and a fleet of 100 foreign fishing boats found in international waters to the south. Baby sharks found among the haul, however, may suggest fishing did occur within the reserve, which is a hammerhead breeding ground. Contrary to authorities, a Chinese Foreign Ministry rep says the vessel's 20 Chinese crew members didn't fish in the reserve and were simply unaware of Ecuadorian rules when they entered it without permission, per Reuters. They were convicted of possessing and transporting protected species on Monday. (Video of a shark being dragged in Florida drew outrage.)",

A patch of green bacteria encased in a round glass dish sold for that sum to an unnamed buyer at a London auction on Wednesday, the AP reports. The furry sample's case is signed on the back by Alexander Fleming, the scientist who sourced the world's first life-saving antibiotic from Penicillium chrysogenum in 1928. His inscription describes this sample as  the mould that first made penicillin \u2014which may not quite be so, the AP notes, since the Scottish-born doctor produced many such medallions. The payday for Fleming's niece, who sold the sample, was substantially higher than the predicted sale price of $5,000. But it may have been a relative bargain for the buyer. Pfizer paid many times that\u2014$51,000 in today's dollars\u2014in 1996 for a similar blob, Quartz reports.

Not everyone was happy to receive one. Queen Elizabeth's husband reportedly griped about getting  another one of these bloody things,  notes Quartz.

The Tubman photo, which Swann specialist Wyatt Day tells Reuters is  remarkable,  shows her seated on a chair and was taken in Auburn in central New York in 1868 or 1869. What makes it unique is that the photo was taken when Tubman was in her 40s, unlike most other pictures that show her when she's much older.  This is what she looked like in her prime Civil War period when she was working as a spy for Lincoln,  Day notes.

But just 3,000 sedans could accomplish about as much, according to a new study. Using a computer formula, MIT researchers discovered that just 3,000 four-person vehicles could provide for 98% of the ride demands of Manhattan residents if everyone opted to share rides, while 2,000 10-passenger vans could account for 95%, reports CNNMoney. The model, particularly suited to self-driving cars since they would be able to automatically re-route themselves when necessary, used data from 3 million taxi rides taken over a week in Manhattan in March 2013 to pose real-time requests, then grouped passengers together based on destinations and sent empty vehicles to await requests in high-traffic areas, which made the system 20% faster, per Gizmodo. The result also meant less congestion and pollution. The downside was that passengers theoretically waited 2.8 minutes for a vehicle, and spent an extra 3.5 minutes traveling because of additional stops. If adopted, such a system would also put thousands of taxi drivers out of work, but  drivers will be able to make the same amount of money working shorter shifts, while the customers will get the same level of service, cities will have fewer cars on roads, the commute experience will be better for everyone ... and the air is cleaner,  the study author says. Motherboard reports it could also save some $121 billion lost annually  as a result of the 5.5 billion hours people spend sitting in traffic (to say nothing of the 2.9 billion gallons of fuel that is also wasted).

This striking example of the gender pay gap sent shock waves through Twitter despite being, in the words of one inside source,  ridiculous.  According to the Hollywood Reporter, the figures cited in Elle were  cobbled together  from multiple publications and weren't comparing the same things. Vanity Fair explains the $300,000 figure is Gadot's pre-negotiated base salary, while Cavill's reported payday would have included post-release bonuses. Still, no one can verify Cavill ever got anything close to $14 million. One source says of the figure:  It certainly isn\u2019t for one picture. That\u2019s insane.  Actors leading their first big blockbuster typically get something more in line with Gadot's reported base salary. Chris Hemsworth made $150,000 for Thor, Adam Driver got $500,000 or so for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Chris Evans is said to have made about what Gadot did for his first outing as Captain America. In fact, sources say that an  apples to apples comparison  between contracts for Gadot and Cavill show she made the same, if not slightly more, upfront as her fellow DC hero. And with the success of Wonder Woman, bonuses and contract re-negotiations should soon kick in.

Now Emswiler is part of a commission studying the possibility of moving Massachusetts from the Eastern time zone to the Atlantic time zone, currently home to Puerto Rico and a number of eastern Canadian provinces, the Wall Street Journal reports. The change would add a fifth time zone to the contiguous US. Advocates say the switch, which would also do away with the twice-a-year daylight saving time switch, could boost the economy by keeping sunlight lovers in state and out shopping later, have public health benefits, and reduce crime. Even supporters of the plan admit Massachusetts wouldn't be able to go it alone. To succeed, most of New England\u2014and potentially New York\u2014would have to make the switch, too, to lessen confusion for financial markets, TV schedules, and travelers. Maine, at least, appears to be on board.

The findings suggest a possible tie between the higher rates of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders in women, as well as higher rates of ADHD and conduct-related issues in men, who are also more likely to be incarcerated. Scientists say the study is important in advancing our understanding of gender-based brain differences, which can then lead to better, more targeted treatment for various conditions down the road. The study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, looked at more than 46,000 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans from 119 healthy subjects and more than 26,000 participants with various psychiatric conditions (including bipolar disorder and ADHD) to measure blood flow in 128 discrete regions of the brain, both at rest and immersed in a concentration task. Scientists observed increased blood flow in women to their prefrontal cortexes (the region that handles impulse control and concentration) and limbic areas (the mood and emotion managers), while men's visual and coordination centers lit up more than women's.

The No. 1 goal in trying to continue a character like Kermit was to make sure that the character stayed ... consistent, but didn't become stale.  A Muppets Studio spokeswoman tells the outlets that longtime Muppets performer Matt Vogel will be taking over the role. Vogel also has a long career in voice work, with IMDb noting he's been in nearly 60 Sesame Street episodes since the late '80s and also worked on The Muppets series. In addition to Kermit, Whitmire had voiced grumpy critic Statler, Rizzo the Rat, and other Muppets. Representatives for Disney, which owns Muppets Studio, didn't immediately return a request for comment Tuesday about the motivation behind the move.",

The study\u2014published Friday in Science\u2014focused on  drylands,  areas that lose more water through evaporation and plant transpiration than they receive in precipitation. Trees in drylands aren't very dense, which can make it difficult to measure possible forest cover.

The new study used high-resolution images of more than 210,000 dryland sites from Google Earth Engine and combined them with observations on the ground. Researchers found between 40% to 47% more forest cover in the world's drylands than previously reported. New forests were found on all continents\u2014besides Antarctica.

Not only did Sharman and his team have to learn in general about Nepalese delicacies like goat spinal cord and yak yogurt, which they weren't terribly familiar with: They also had to figure out how to keep the victuals fresh during the nine-day trek to Base Camp and how to set up an entire kitchen and dining area on the icy landscape. This wasn't the first unconventional meal Sharman and his crew had overseen. Since last year, Sharman and his One Star House Party pop-up restaurant have been roaming the world, feeding free-spending diners in exotic locales such as Bangkok and Beijing. The 15 or so paying guests for the Everest shindig, which Sharman calls  humbling,  coughed up $1,050 for accommodations and food during the 14-day experience.

The buyer apparently overpaid. Sotheby's now says the artwork is a fake, not painted by Parmigianino in the 16th century but by a forger within the last 100 years, reports NPR. Before its sale, some had suspected St. Jerome was painted by an associate of Parmigianino, but all agreed it was 400 years old. When research lab Orion Analytical revealed a $10 million Dutch painting supposedly by Frans Hals to be a fake in October, however, it put all other artworks connected to the same dealer into question, including two others that turned out to be fakes, per ArtNet and the Art Newspaper. The dealer, Giuliano Ruffini, had also owned St. Jerome. A technical analysis by Orion Analytical's researchers found 21 areas of the painting contained the synthetic green pigment phthalocyanine green. It was  first used in paints nearly four centuries after Parmigianino died  and was not the result of a restoration, according to Sotheby's complaint. Sotheby's is now demanding St. Jerome's consignor, Lionel de Saint Donat-Pourrieres, repay $672,000 he received from the 2012 sale.

The forecast has two numbers to watch: Trump's approval ratings among Republicans (currently 85% at Gallup) and among independents (33%). Generally speaking, if a president dips below 85% among his own party and sits in the 30s among independents, his party is in real danger of losing control of one or both houses of Congress in the midterms. (The GOP currently controls both.) The analysis warns that Trump's public criticism of the GOP's Freedom Caucus in the wake of the health care failure is only making things worse for him by ratcheting up divisions within the party.  The more the GOP gets bogged down in process instead of progress, the more likely it is that their voters become disillusioned and that independent voters abandon them,  writes Amy Walter.  Combine these ingredients with an energized Democratic base and you have all the ingredients for a disastrous midterm election in 2018 for the GOP.  There's a lot of time before the elections, of course, but the analysis has a reminder of the consequences: Think all these Russia stories are troubling for the White House now?

Charges that shed light on what an ex-FBI special agent tells the Post is the  murky world of Russian intel services  are said to include hacking, economic espionage, trade secret theft, and wire fraud. Per the Post, this would be the first time Russian government officials have had US cybercrimes charges filed against them. What irks US officials most is that the FSB employees implicated in this case work for a division within the agency that's akin to the FBI's own cybercrime unit, which one official tells the Post is  pretty sad.  If any of the suspects are indeed in Russia, there's no extradition treaty that the US can tap into to haul them to the States, but the Post notes charges such as these, plus possible sanctions, can still wield a  deterrent effect  against future criminality (and the suspects can still get busted if they visit countries that will ship them to the US).

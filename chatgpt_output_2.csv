"(Jun 16, 2015  11:51 PM CDT) Revived by a fresh-faced shooting superstar and a first-year coach who made them believe, the Golden State Warriors again reign supreme. Their 40-year NBA championship drought is finally over—and a half-century of misery in Cleveland drags on. LeBron James just didn't have enough help. Stephen Curry and finals MVP Andre Iguodala scored 25 points apiece, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double, and the Warriors—using a barrage of 3-pointers in the fourth quarter—won their first title since 1975 by finishing off James and the Cavaliers 105-97 in Game 6 in Cleveland. For the first time since Gerald Ford was in the White House, disco was in vogue, and Rick Barry was flicking in under-handed free throws, the best pro basketball team resides in the Bay Area. And these Warriors are a lot like Barry and his old crew: fluid, balanced, together—just like coach Steve Kerr had hoped. After falling behind by two points early in the third quarter, the Warriors took control with Curry, the league's MVP, and Iguodala, who made his first start of the season in Game 4, leading the way.  World champs,  Curry said, letting the title sink in.  This is truly special. This group is a special group. From the time we started the season this is what we envisioned and a lot of hard work goes into it, all the way down to the last minute of this game. This is what it's all about.",Warriors End <MASK>-Year Title Drought,40,40,Copy(40),< MASK > = 40

Kathleen Savio was found dead in a dry bathtub in 2004, and her death had been considered an accidental drowning. Authorities reopened the Savio case in November as police were investigating the disappearance of Stacy Peterson, who remains missing. Drew Peterson has not been charged in either case; he maintains his innocence, saying Stacy, 24, has run off with another man.

"(Nov 17, 2014  3:46 AM) A 10-year-old Pennsylvania boy who accidentally shot himself in the face with his father's handgun is still alive thanks to two police officers who arrived minutes after a 911 call. The boy  was lifeless at the time we arrived,  the chief of police in Darby Township tells CBS.  One officer drove, one officer performed CPR in the back of the car. They got him to the nearest trauma center ... and he actually was revived.  The boy, who found the .357 magnum in his father's car, shot himself in the jaw and  I believe the exit wound was actually on the back of his head,  the chief says. Police say the boy and his sister were in the car waiting for their father to finish work late Saturday night when the boy found the handgun; their mother had reportedly dropped them off. After he was revived at the local hospital, he was airlifted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in extremely critical condition; his condition is now listed as stable but guarded. The police chief says there's no sign of foul play, but interviews are still being conducted and there is a chance charges could be filed, reports the Delco Times.

"(Apr 2, 2014  10:35 AM CDT) UPS drivers left work for 90 minutes to protest the firing of a colleague—and found themselves in hot water not long afterward, the company tells the New York Daily News. Twenty were fired Monday, while 230 were told they had their jobs only until replacements were trained. A rep for UPS says the Queens, NY, drivers knew the protest put their jobs at risk. The drivers were demonstrating following the dismissal of union activist Jairo Reyes, who'd worked for the company for 24 years, local union head Tim Sylvester tells the paper. They believed he hadn't been treated as  innocent until proven guilty,  the Queens Chronicle reports.  UPS takes millions from the city and yet it’s going to bankrupt 250 families just because our guys stood up for a fellow worker,  Sylvester says. He's referring to a $43 million contract with government agencies as well as a government program that cuts parking ticket penalties for UPS. In 2006, UPS paid $20 million in parking fees; that figure fell to $1 million last year under the program, the Daily News notes. A public advocate has called on UPS to change its mind on the firings, and local politicians are hoping to launch talks. The company, for its part, has said that a collective bargaining agreement  states that if any employee participates in an unauthorized work stoppage, they can be terminated.",UPS Sacks 250 Drivers After <MASK>-Minute Protest,90,250,Copy(90),UPS Sacks 250 Drivers After 90-Minute Protest
"(Jul 5, 2019  12:38 PM CDT) Chicago was one of the cities that lost out to Rio de Janeiro back in 2009 for the right to host the 2016 Olympics. Bribery apparently would have helped. Sergio Cabral, a former Rio governor, told a court this week that he bought up to nine International Olympic Committee votes with a total of $2 million, reports Reuters. Two of the alleged bribe-takers are former gold medalists—Ukranian pole vaulter Sergey Bubka and Russian swimmer Alexander Popov. However, both denied Friday that they were paid to vote for Rio, reports the AP. The IOC said it is investigating and has contacted both men.  I have to admit that I am extremely surprised at the appearance of such information with the illegal use of my name,  said Popov, per the New York Times. Bubka rejected  all the false claims made by the former Rio state governor who is currently serving a long prison sentence for corruption.  Cabral detailed a scheme in which he gave $2 million to Lamine Diack, former president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, who allegedly dispersed the money. Also implicated is Carlos Nuzman, former head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee. Nuzman was previously charged, and Diack goes on trial next year. The money allegedly came from Brazilian businessman Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho, who was arrested and released but is now at large.",Cost to Host Olympics?

"(Aug 7, 2013  12:47 PM CDT) It turns out there is a limit to how shameless lawyers can be in paying themselves in class action lawsuits. A federal appeals court last week threw out a $3 million settlement that Procter & Gamble had agreed to in a class-action suit over its allegedly rash-inducing Pampers Dry Max diapers, because $2.73 million of that settlement went to the lawyers. That left only a couple hundred thousand to distribute among the few dozen named plaintiffs, who would have gotten $1000 each, the Wall Street Journal reports. Unnamed class members were given the right to a one-box refund—something the company had offered independent of the settlement.  The relief that this settlement provides to unnamed class members is illusory,  one judge wrote, according to Bloomberg.  But one fact about this settlement is concrete and indisputable: $2.73 million is $2.73 million.  It was a 2-1 decision; the dissenting judge pointed out that without the settlement class members would have gotten even less. P&G can now try to have the case dismissed or attempt to work out a new settlement, notes the Journal.",Lawyers Halted From Taking $2.7M of $<MASK>M Settlement,3,3,Copy(3),<MASK> = 3
"(Aug 5, 2010  12:58 PM CDT) Ah, the plight of a small business owner, always bullied by unfair government regulation. Take it from 7-year-old Julie Murphy. Inspired by a cartoon show, Murphy decided to set up a lemonade stand at a monthly art fair in Northeast Portland. People were drinking down the 50-cent cups of Kool-Aid great, until a government inspector came over and demanded to see her temporary restaurant license, the Oregonian reports. Such licenses cost $120, and naturally, Julie didn’t have one. Others at the fair encouraged her to give out the lemonade, in exchange for donations, but the inspectors returned and ordered the girl—who soon began crying—to close shop, or face a $500 fine. The county health supervisor stands by that decision, particularly because Julie had set up at a big event.

"(Jul 21, 2014  6:45 AM CDT) A set of keys and a toothbrush may seem like innocuous, everyday items, but they become sacred when they belong to the dead. So when Sky News reporter Colin Brazier was caught during a live broadcast yesterday riffling through the personal effects—toothbrush and keys among them—of one of the deceased passengers at the MH17 crash site in Ukraine, people around the world responded angrily, calling the act  disrespectful  and  appalling.  In a statement, Sky News says it has received a  handful  of complaints from viewers, reports the Guardian, and both Sky News and Brazier  apologize profusely for any offense caused.  Brazier, who was nominated for this year's Royal Television Society presenter of the year award, was standing amidst a pile of luggage, reports news.com.au, when he said:  I think it’s a small girl’s bag by the looks of things. A set of keys, a toothbrush.  He then stopped himself from riffling through the luggage further when he said,  We really shouldn't be doing this, I suppose.  He went on to say he'd encountered scores of body parts charred to the point of being unrecognizable.  It is a truly macabre, horrific situation,  he said of the carnage in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, where 283 passengers and 15 crew perished.  There is a degree of anarchy and lawlessness.

"(Jan 27, 2017  2:25 PM) President Trump had his first meeting with a foreign leader since taking office Friday when he held a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, the Wall Street Journal. The main goal of the meeting was to start setting up a trade deal between the two countries that would take effect when the UK leaves the EU. (Trump called Brexit a  fantastic thing  for the UK.) Trump highlighted the  special relationship  between the US and UK, and May said she wanted to make that relationship  even stronger.  According to CNN, May said that while the UK won't always agree with the US, the two countries will have an  open and frank discussion  about the issues. Some of those disagreements were already apparent during Friday's press conference. May reiterated her support for sanctions on Russia, and while Trump said it was too early to talk about lifting sanctions, he said he hopes to have as good a relationship with that country as the US has with the UK. And the BBC reports May said Trump told her he was  100% behind NATO,  an organization he has repeatedly derided as obsolete.

Traces of highly toxic methanol were found in the victims, who were mostly poor day laborers and rickshaw-pullers who bought the hooch in pouches for some 25 cents a liter, the BBC reports. Authorities demolished makeshift distilleries and bars after the deaths, and pledged to crack down on corrupt cops involved in the illegal liquor trade.  A section of low-ranking policemen may be involved.

The Dow industrials lost 1338 points, or 6.3%, ending the day below the 20K mark at 19898. After a brutal few weeks, the Dow has now lost nearly all of its gains since President Trump's inauguration, the AP reports. Wednesday's losses deepened after a temporary halt was triggered in the early afternoon.

"(Feb 11, 2014  2:38 AM) A Beaumont, Texas, gun shop got a little more attention that it had bargained for with a rather unusual promotional stunt—a teenager in a banana costume standing by the road with an AK-47 on Saturday morning. Police briefly detained the 18-year-old after fielding calls from concerned citizens who saw him at a busy intersection, reports the Houston Chronicle. The police press release notes,  The rifle had a drum magazine attached with at least a 50-round capacity.  The teenager, who had the rifle across his back with the barrel pointing down and carried a sign with an arrow pointing to the store, was cited for violating a city ordinance that bans soliciting along roadways, KMBT reports. Golden Triangle Tactical owner Derek Poe says the plan was to alert customers to the store's new location.

"(Dec 31, 2009  8:00 AM) Stocks have rebounded mightily since the dark days of March, though analysts warn the dazzling recovery could make for a lackluster 2010, or even auger a double-dip recession or '30s-style yo-yoing markets. The good news first: Barring a disastrous close today, the Dow will be up around 61% since March lows, and 20% for the year, the best showing since 2003. The S&P and NASDAQ are also on track to have their best year since then. But history suggests caution may be in order for 2010, the Wall Street Journal notes. The big gain after a dizzying fall smacks of the 1930s and '70s, when stocks stagnated or even lost their value again.

The 9/11 Commission never mentioned the mysterious phone call—and the executive director tells Greenwald he has no idea what the Attorney General is talking about. Further, Mukasey's claim that the restrictive law kept the government from saving lives is demonstrably false: FISA doesn’t, and never has, required a warrant for tapping foreign targets.

The NRA's Political Victory Fund PAC put up $2 million to back the 30-second spot, the association's first ad campaign of Election 2016, and it's going right for one of Hillary Clinton's weak spots: Benghazi. The  Stop Clinton, Vote Trump  ad, which will air in six battleground states, puts security contractor and Marine Corps veteran Mark  Oz  Geist front and center to blast Clinton based on his own experiences fighting the attack on the US mission in 2012, which killed four Americans. As he strolls through a cemetery, Geist says,  A lot of people say they're not going to vote this November because their candidate didn't win. Well, I know some other people who won't be voting this year, either. Hillary as President? No thanks. I served in Benghazi. My friends didn't make it. They did their part. Do yours.  A Trump aide tweeted a picture Tuesday that said Clinton  murdered  Ambassador Chris Stevens, and Trump himself used Benghazi to lay into Clinton last week, tweeting,  If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.  But in an interview Tuesday in the New Yorker, Dr. Anne Stevens, the ambassador's sister, concedes that the Libyan facility wasn't adequately protected—but she notes that wasn't Clinton's fault.  The Benghazi Mission was understaffed. … But, again, Chris knew that. He decided to take the risk to go there. It is not something they did to him. It is something he took on himself.

"(Jul 9, 2018  10:45 AM CDT) He shared the screen with drag queen Divine, starred in Damn Yankees, and put out a No. 1 record. Now,  sad news  regarding Tab Hunter, who made hearts thump in general in the '50s: The actor and singer has died, just three days before he would have turned 87, per a Facebook page tied to the star. Allan Glaser, Hunter's romantic partner for more than 30 years, confirmed his death of a heart attack caused by a blood clot, calling his passing  unexpected and sudden,  per the Hollywood Reporter. Born in 1931 as Arthur Andrew Kelm, Hunter's stage name was brainstormed by talent agent Henry Willson, who also repped Rock Hudson. His blond surfer image nabbed him magazine covers and the role of Washington Senators star Joe Hardy in 1958's Damn Yankees. Hunter's 1957 Dot Records recording of  Young Love,  which stayed at No. 1 on the charts for six weeks, also spurred the creation of Warner Bros. Records after Jack Warner became irritated he didn't have his own record company to showcase the voice of his studio's star. Hunter appeared alongside Divine in John Waters' Polyester in 1981, as well as in 1985's Lust in the Dust, which also co-starred Divine. Although he was often seen out and about with Natalie Wood, Sophia Loren, and other big-name actresses, Hunter had a relationship with Anthony Perkins, and he confirmed he was gay in his 2005 autobiography. Meanwhile, his longtime love Glaser produced a 2015 documentary about Hunter entitled Tab Hunter Confidential, in which the actor discussed being a closeted gay man in Hollywood while simultaneously being seen as one of its biggest hunks.","A Hollywood Heartthrob, Singer Is Dead at <MASK>",86,87,"Subtract(87,1)",<MASK> = 87

Now, almost a quarter-century later, a judge says the 79-year-old's conviction rested on a scientific inaccuracy—and the former New York businessman is finally out of prison, the AP reports. According to a review of his case finished in June,  much of what was presented to Lee's jury as science is now conceded to be little more than superstition.  But Lee, who was initially sentenced to life without parole, the Morning Call notes, is not entirely out of the woods: Prosecutors say that there's more evidence against him, and they're likely to appeal. Prosecutors have 120 days to make their decision. For his part, Lee holds that a fire in the Pocono Mountains which resulted in his daughter's death was an accident, the AP notes. But investigators decades ago believed the fire was arson due to its intensity, which was once thought to indicate that an accelerant was used. Other features left in wood and windows after the fire were also seen as evidence of arson, but this is no longer considered accurate.

The figure comes despite bigger donations from dioceses around the world and the Vatican bank's $62 million donation to the pope. Officials say weak markets—particularly in real estate—as well as high employee and media costs cut into the budget. The Vatican's television, radio, and newspaper organizations are expensive and bring in little. On the bright side for the Vatican, donations from believers for charity works were up, from $67.7 million in 2010 to $69.7 million in 2011. That money, however, doesn't factor into the operating budget. The Vatican city state, a separate entity, also boasted a surplus of $27 million.

Randall Hackett, 58, and his 28-year-old son-in-law, Alexander Auerbach, had decided to swim part of the 4-mile distance of Crane Beach in Ipswich around 5pm Tuesday, report the Salem News and WCVB. Both are strong swimmers, and they were clad in wetsuits, but family members were nonetheless concerned when neither had returned to shore after an hour and a half, per ABC News. Shortly after family members reported the pair missing, Auerbach was found on the beach around 7:30pm, about a mile south of the men's starting point, but he said he'd lost track of Hackett because of rip currents and heavy fog. For two hours, the Coast Guard, police, and fire department combed the water before rescuers using an infrared camera aboard a helicopter spotted Hackett treading water a quarter-mile offshore, per WCVB. Hackett was plucked from the water around 9:30pm and returned to the beach, where he walked into his wife's arms.

Andree was sentenced to a one-year prison sentence, which he has served, and 360 lashes, which his family was  led to believe  would be voided because of his age and health, his daughter tells the BBC.

"(Mar 10, 2015  1:50 PM CDT) The US is the only country out of 38 that doesn't require paid maternity leave, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. And while the US Family and Medical Leave Act does provide for up to 12 weeks of leave for some employees with a new baby or other qualifying family situation, it's unpaid leave. A global telecom company, however, has decided it's not waiting for mandates from each of its affiliate nations, including the US: Vodafone will offer 16 paid weeks of maternity leave, covering new moms in the US, Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, and Europe, CBS News reports. And once moms are back behind the desk, the company takes its progressive policy one step further, paying a mother's full salary for a 30-hour workweek for the first six months. The changes will be implemented by the end of 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. KPMG research commissioned by Vodafone estimated that businesses offering 16 paid weeks would dole out $28 billion a year globally for the benefits. But it also found that by saving $47 billion by not having to recruit and train new employees taking over for moms opting out of the workforce, companies would save $19 billion a year collectively. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao also thinks that since fewer moms will permanently off-ramp, his company can boost more women who work there (35% of its employees) into upper-management roles—only 21% of its international upper ranks are currently made up of women.

For the second year in a row, Suzanne Collins' work was among the most  challenged  books, as reported yesterday by the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom. The association defines a challenge as  a formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness.  Collins' million-selling novels ranked No. 3 on the association's list, rising from No. 5 last year. In last year's list, when just the title book of the trilogy was in the top 10, complaints included  sexually explicit  and  unsuited to age group and violence.  For the new study, which also included Catching Fire and Mockingjay, the objections were more varied, and harsher, including,  Anti-ethnic; anti-family; insensitivity; offensive language; occult/satanic; violence.  Barbara Jones, director of the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom, thinks anticipation for the Hunger Games film led to closer criticism of the books. The most challenged works were Lauren Myracle's tween novels ttyl, ttfn, l8r, and g8r, followed by Kim Dong Hwa's The Color of Earth series.",Hunger Games Hits No. <MASK> on Challenged Books List,3,3,Copy(3),<MASK> = 3

A group letter sent Tuesday to CEO Mark Zuckerberg argues that younger children—the app is intended for those under 13—aren't ready to have social media accounts, navigate the complexities of online relationships, or protect their own privacy. Facebook launched the free Messenger Kids app in December, pitching it as a way for children to chat with family members and parent-approved friends. It doesn't give kids separate Facebook or Messenger accounts. Rather, the app works as an extension of a parent's account, and parents get controls such as the ability to decide who their kids can chat with, the AP reports.",Experts Urge Facebook to Drop App for Under-<MASK>s,13,13,Copy(13),<MASK> = 13

The state abolished the death penalty in April 2012, but only for future crimes; today's decision by the Connecticut Supreme Court concerned whether that ban should also affect those who were on death row prior to the 2012 ruling. The  deeply divided  court ruled 4-3 that the death penalty is a violation of the state's constitution, reports the Hartford Courant. The decision will affect Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes, who were sentenced to die for killing a mother and her two daughters in 2007 in the high-profile Petit home invasion. The ruling comes in an appeal from Eduardo Santiago, whose attorneys had argued that any execution carried out after repeal would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Santiago faced the possibility of lethal injection for a 2000 murder-for-hire killing in West Hartford. The repeal eliminated the death penalty while setting life in prison without the possibility of release as the punishment for crimes formerly considered capital offenses. Connecticut has had just one execution since 1960.

Police departments have been snapping up the unmanned aircraft, whose cameras could be used for everything from missing-person searches to catching drug dealers. Now law enforcement is waiting on the FAA to lay out rules for using the drones—guidelines that must be set by May 14 under a February law signed by President Obama. The FAA must rule on how far and high the drones will be allowed to go, as well as who will be eligible to launch them. While backers cite a  public interest  in getting the drones off the ground as soon as possible, civil rights groups worry about invasive domestic surveillance and safety advocates say that ramming the guidelines through in the next two weeks will endanger other aircraft. Though the May 14 decision will apply only to police and first-responder drones weighing less than 4.4 pounds, the gadgets could someday be used for more mundane tasks like selling real estate and dusting crops, the Los Angeles Times notes.",Due in <MASK> Weeks: FAA Rules for Drones in US Skies,2,2,Trans(two),<MASK> = 2

Victor Twartz of Sydney was released on bail when he appeared in Sydney's Downing Center Local Court, charged with importing a commercial quantity of cocaine last month. He did not enter a plea and will appear in court on Oct. 6. Twartz faces a potential life prison sentence if he is convicted of importing 10 pounds of the drug into Sydney Airport on a July 8 flight from New Delhi.

In the highest-profile incident, a former Florida State student said Winston sexually assaulted her, though he said the sex was consensual. He was never charged or arrested. Smith and Licht said repeatedly over the past two months that they were comfortable with the prospect of taking Winston, who also generated negative headlines for shoplifting crab legs from a supermarket.

Cerro Gordo, a 300-acre town nestled in the Inyo Mountains not far from Death Valley, has a  Wild West  history thanks to the discovery of silver there in 1865; within four years, mining operations made it the largest producer of silver and lead in the state, and it later became the largest producer of zinc carbonates in the entire country. But that era ended, and by 1950, Cerro Gordo was basically abandoned. The previous owners, brothers who inherited the town from their family—the property listing says the town had been owned by the same family for decades—decided to sell it while attempting to keep its history intact, and received a dozen serious offers after announcing the sale in June. The original asking price was $925000, but Brent Underwood and Jon Bier ended up purchasing it for $1.4 million, the New York Times reports. The entrepreneurs' plan is to revive the town, developing it into a destination while preserving its history. There are nearly two dozen buildings on the property, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, including a church and theater, a general store, a museum, a two-story hotel, an eight-bed bunkhouse, and of course a saloon; in addition to its iconic swinging doors and two pianos, the saloon features a bloodstain underneath three bullet holes on one wall.

His take:  With two more jobs reports coming before the Fed’s September meeting, the one at which many people now think they will begin hiking rates, the June report could say almost anything. The July and August reports will be fresher and more important in swaying the Fed’s decision on rates, is the thinking.

The latest stats out of Johns Hopkins University, meanwhile, show that the worldwide total of virus cases is more than 2.7 million, with nearly 194000 deaths. That means the number of cases in the US account for nearly a third of all the cases in the world, the WSJ notes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the latest development  staggering,  saying at her weekly presser on Friday that  many people, as am I, are quite shaken  by it, per CNN. Meanwhile, some states already are starting to slowly reopen to mitigate the economic pain, a move that health experts warn could backfire.  We don't want to open things up, have a huge surge in cases, and have to lock everything down again,  a rep from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security tells the WSJ.  That would be even more detrimental to our society and our economy if we have to keep yo-yoing back and forth.","A Month Ago in US, <MASK> Had Died From Virus.

"(Nov 17, 2009  2:30 AM) Terror suspects have been paid over $1 million in living expenses in the last two years under a controversial British program that keeps them under virtual house arrest. The suspects—who security services say pose a threat, but who can't be prosecuted because evidence against them is too sensitive to disclose in court—have received funds for accommodations, phone bills, and other expenses on top of welfare payments, the Telegraph reports. Opposition lawmakers say the sums paid out for living expenses are one of many reasons why the program, which currently includes 13 suspects, should be scrapped. The system  denies due process to the defendant, does not provide a reliable remedy to the security problem posed by terrorist suspects, and on top of all that costs hundreds of thousands of pounds,  complained a Conservative politician said.",Living Costs for UK Terror Suspects Top $<MASK>M,1,1,Copy(1),<MASK> = 1
"(Jan 10, 2017  11:49 AM) A young reporter for the Daily Telegraph was journeying from Poland to Germany in August 1939 when she spotted what would turn out to be the  scoop of the century : German troops huddled along the border, per the BBC. Adolf Hitler invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, jump-starting World War II, and although Clare Hollingworth's Telegraph story on those troops didn't cite her by name (articles often didn't have bylines back then), it was her reporting coup. Hollingworth died Tuesday in Hong Kong, her home for more than three decades, at the age of 105, a family friend confirmed to AFP, via the Guardian.  We are sad to announce that after an illustrious career spanning a century of news, celebrated war correspondent Clare Hollingworth died this evening in Hong Kong,  a post on the Celebrate Clare Hollingworth Facebook page read. The headline that accompanied her breaking story in the Telegraph, after she'd been on the job for less than a week, read  1000 tanks massed on Polish border—Ten divisions reported ready for swift [action].  She also scooped the Nazis spilling over into Poland a few days later, as well as penned an exclusive on British spy Kim Philby in 1963, though the Guardian didn't run it for fear of being sued for libel. Her reporting work took her all over the world, including to conflicts in Vietnam, the Middle East, and China. She even came close to death in 1946 when she was just yards away from a bomb blast in Jerusalem that killed almost 100 people. She nabbed the James Cameron Award for Journalism in 1994, as well as other reporting honors. She's survived by a stepdaughter, Hilary, as well as a niece, Jennifer, and a nephew, Richard.

"(Jul 1, 2013  7:02 AM CDT) Less than a week after Wendy Davis filibustered the Texas bill that would shutter most of the state's abortion clinics, state lawmakers have returned to the Capitol to take up the bill again. The first time around, the bill failed on the last day of a special legislative session; Gov. Rick Perry called for a second special session to start today, and Republicans are vowing to get the job done faster this time. The process must start over entirely, the AP reports, but as long as supporters of the bill can hustle a bit, there likely won't be a repeat of Davis' feat because it will come to a final vote while there's still too much time left in the session for a filibuster. ( No human being can talk for two weeks,  Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Saturday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Davis was also helped along by hundreds of protesters who cheered until the clock ran out, and opponents of the bill are planning to mobilize again. But this time around, there may be  more presence by law enforcement  to ensure that doesn't happen again, says one Republican state senator. The state troopers wouldn't comment on specific plans, but a spokesperson acknowledged that  when necessary, we will adjust our security measures as a situation merits.  The legislation has already been resubmitted, the Los Angeles Times reports. The session begins at 2pm, and the bill could come up in committee as soon as tomorrow. But it may not come up for a vote this week, if lawmakers break for the holiday. The session can last up to 30 days, but  we should be out of here in 10 days to two weeks,  predicted one Republican state senator.

"(Aug 10, 2014  9:13 AM CDT) The Islamic State's assault on the Yazidi minority community is every bit as horrific as might be expected, with Iraq's human rights minister telling Reuters today that the militant group has killed at least 500 Yazidis—and buried some of those alive.   We have striking evidence obtained from Yazidis fleeing Sinjar and some who escaped death, and also crime scene images that show indisputably that the gangs of the Islamic States have executed at least 500 Yazidis after seizing Sinjar,  Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said, calling the killings a  vicious atrocity.  He added that some 300 women have been taken as slaves. Sudani's claim comes as the Telegraph notes that the Islamic State has threatened hundreds of Yazidis in towns under its control with execution if they refused to convert to Islam by today. That deadline has now passed, notes Reuters; it's unclear if the slaughter referenced by Sudani involves the Yazidis under threat to convert.

"(Nov 1, 2017  12:09 PM CDT)  I carried my own child. I didn't know he was mine.  That's what a California woman is saying after she became pregnant with her own son while serving as a surrogate for a Chinese couple. After connecting with the couple through a surrogacy agency in California, Jessica Allen, 31, was implanted with an embryo in April 2016, reports ABC News. Six weeks later, Allen was told she was expecting twins and assumed the embryo had split in two. But that wasn't in fact the case. A month after Allen gave birth in December, a DNA test showed one of the two babies had developed from the embryo, while the other was Allen's biological child, reports the New York Post.  We were floored,  says Allen, who, in a rare case of superfetation, had become pregnant while already pregnant, per ABC. A doctor tells Live Science that fewer than a dozen cases of superfetation are recorded in medical literature. Though more cases may go unreported or even unnoticed, superfetation is extremely uncommon because, for one thing, a woman usually stops ovulating when pregnant. After Allen was implanted with the embryo, however, her ovaries released another egg that was fertilized. Allen had no contact with the two infants immediately after birth, but she says she knew they weren't twins when she saw a photo showing  one was much lighter than the other,  per ABC; Allen is white, while her husband is black. The Post describes the complicated legal battle that followed before the couple gained custody of their son in February. They now describe him as an unexpected treasure.

This decision was difficult, but necessary, as the Dressbarn chain has not been operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment,  Dressbarn chief financial officer Steven Taylor said in a statement, announcing that the women's apparel chain plans to begin a  wind down of its retail operations.  The chain, which has been around for more than 50 years, said stores and the Dressbarn website will continue operating normally for now, and employees will be notified when store closing dates have been determined, CNBC reports.

She died after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year,  says a family spokesman. Madikizela-Mandela's own activism against the apartheid regime led to her being imprisoned for months and spending years under house arrest, per the AP. Her political activism was marred by a kidnapping and assault conviction in 1991, for which she was fined. She faced these allegations again during the 1997 hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a panel that investigated apartheid-era crimes.

The study of 125 women expands upon what the BBC reports are some fairly broad stats: Only 4% of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30% do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As LiveScience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. (The average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. The study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant.  The emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is,  says a study researcher. The upshot? Perhaps a  delivered by  date would be better than a  due date,  suggests a spokesperson for the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

A 15-year study of half a million British women finds that a woman who has undergone a tonsillectomy or appendectomy has a 49% and 34% higher chance of getting pregnant, respectively, than a woman with her appendix and tonsils intact, reports the Telegraph. A woman who's had both procedures has a 43% higher chance of getting pregnant. One of the researchers says the study  confirms beyond doubt that removal of inflamed organs or organs likely to suffer from repeated inflammation, in women, improves their chances of pregnancy  rather than reduces those chances, as some doctors believe. It isn't clear why the procedures are linked to increased fertility\u2014doctors previously suggested scar tissue around the fallopian tubes after an appendectomy reduced the chance of pregnancy\u2014but it may simply be that women who have more sex are more likely to develop an infection. However, inflammation in the body can affect a woman's ovaries and womb, per the BBC, and it's possible that  the removal of these tissues makes an alteration to their immune system  that affects reproduction, says a scientist not involved in the study.  If true, this may ultimately give doctors and scientists some new ideas for novel drugs or therapies to enhance women's fertility.  The researchers stress they're not advocating that otherwise healthy women have the procedures, notes CNN. (This procedure may double a woman's chance of conception.)",

Chinese group Tzaneen International tabled the single bid in Friday's auction, Spanish news agency Europa Press said. The receiver had set a minimum price of $30.3 million. If no better bid is received by September, the sale will go through. Tzaneen International reportedly plans to invest up to $108 million in the airport and make it a cargo hub. The offer is for the airport infrastructure only, not adjacent land. Central has one of Europe's longest runways and was designed to handle 2.5 million passengers a year. The construction was heavily funded by the Caja Castilla La Mancha savings bank\u2014the first of Spain's troubled savings banks to be bailed out, in 2010. Another largely unused airport and symbol of wasteful spending is Castellon, on Spain's eastern coast. It cost around $162 million and opened in 2011.",

Indeed, he kept up the harassment until she finally expressed her thanks in a meeting organized by a mediator.

The revelation comes by way of Kevin Burke, who filed a FOIA request in December 2014 regarding the  TSA Randomizer  iPad application, which was basically used like so: A TSA agent holding an iPad would tap the app. If a left arrow appeared, the traveler went in the left security-check lane; a right arrow, right. A 2014 Bloomberg article explained some of the reasoning behind the software, which mainly related to the use of the speedier PreCheck lane and the selection of the fliers who would randomly be directed there from the regular lane. The randomness would make it tougher for would-be terrorists to identify security-screening patterns they would use for their benefit, Bloomberg explains, and help dispel the appearance of profiling. Cost-wise, Burke's headline is a little more jaw-dropping:  The TSA Randomizer iPad App Cost $1.4 Million.  But a TSA rep tells Mashable $336,413.59 was paid to IBM for  mobile application development,  with the aforementioned $47,400 earmarked for the randomizer software; Mashable reports the $1.4 million is the total of the overall contract with IBM.

A US District Court jury decided Apple had violated a 1998 patent for technology that improves processor efficiency\u2014a patent owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing division\u2014by incorporating that technology into the A7, A8, and A8X processors found in its iPhone 5, 6, and 6 Plus models. The jury also found the patent is valid, a claim Apple unsuccessfully tried to take up with the US Patent and Trademark Office before. Presiding Judge William Conley broke the trial down into three phases: liability, damages, and whether Apple had willfully violated the patent, which could lead to more penalties. Indeed, WARF had filed for triple damages because it said the patent infringement was  willful, intentional, and in conscious disregard of WARF's right,  per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Noting the Malaysia Airlines brand has been blemished in some markets, Mueller, hired last month by state investor Khazanah, adds the airline will rebrand in September, but he remains vague on the details.

Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 to 2011, told the audience at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday that the most likely scenario for the Internet fragmenting is a  bifurcation  into an Chinese Internet and a US-led  non-Chinese Internet,  CNBC reports.  If you look at China, and I was just there, the scale of the companies that are being built, the services being built ... is phenomenal,  he said.  Chinese Internet is a greater percentage of the GDP of China, which is a big number, than the same percentage of the US, which is also a big number.  Schmidt predicted that we will see  fantastic leadership in products and services from China \u2014but warned that there is a  real danger that along with those products and services comes a different leadership regime from government, with censorship, controls, etc.  Schmidt's remarks come amid resignations at Google to protest the company's reported plans for  Project Dragonfly,  a version of its search engine that censor results Beijing does not approve of, Tech Times reports. (Schmidt stepped down as chairman of Google's parent company last year.)",

Lady M Confections says David Lliviganay, 32, smuggled at least 1,020 of its cakes out of its Queens warehouse over a few months and resold them to other vendors, the New York Times reports. Lady M's cakes, including creations like its Rabbit Stamp Signature Mille Cr\u00eape, sell for $90 each, meaning the delivery driver stole cakes worth $89,250, the company says. The company says Llivaganay started pilfering cakes in late 2018, but it didn't become aware of the theft until months later, when it discovered that  unauthorized resellers  were selling them at discount. Surveillance video revealed Llivaganay shifting cakes from company freezers to his car on dozens of occasions, according to the company, whose products have been raved about by celebrities including Oprah Winfrey. According to court records, Llivaganay was charged with 15 counts of petty larceny and pleaded guilty in July. He is due to be sentenced later this month. The company's lawsuit is seeking the value of the cakes, plus interest and punitive damages for his  malicious  behavior, the Guardian reports. Llivaganay, the lawsuit states,  violated his duty of loyalty  to the company.",

Ramon Christopher Blanchett submitted a self-prepared income tax return in 2017 along with two W-2 forms: One that was accurate, showing $1,399 in income and no federal income tax withholding, and one that was decidedly not accurate, showing $17,098 in wages and $1 million in withholding. That one should have listed just $2,098 in wages and no withholding, according to a federal forfeiture complaint obtained by the Tampa Bay Times. But the IRS didn't realize the issue in time, and the US Treasury issued a check for $980,000 to Blanchett. The Tampa man managed to get the money, despite the fact that SunTrust Bank initially froze the funds for suspected fraud. The bank later closed the accounts and sent Blanchett a cashier's check, which he put into a money market account with Grow Financial Credit Union, claiming the money was from his late father's estate, according to the complaint. He managed to buy a Lexus, but the authorities realized what had happened and got a federal seizure warrant. The IRS seized the car, the remaining $919,251, and is trying to get back the $809 insurance refund Blanchett got after he canceled his policy on the car, but Blanchett has not been charged with a federal crime. The IRS would not comment on the matter to the Times.",

The New York Diocese of Brooklyn says the men, who were abused between the ages of 8 and 12 and are now ages 19 to 21, will receive $6.875 million each under the terms of the settlement, NBC News reports. Angelo Serrano, former director of religious education at St. Lucy's-St. Patrick's Church, was arrested in 2009 after one of the boys told his mother about the abuse. The 67-year-old is currently serving a 15-year sentence. Lawyers for the victims say other boys were severely abused, but  the statute of limitations prevents their claims from being brought.  After the victims sued, the diocese argued that it shouldn't be held responsible for the abuse because Serrano was officially a volunteer, not an employee, even though he received a stipend from the church, the New York Times reports. A judge, however, found that priests and parish workers ignored signs of abuse, including the fact that Serrano regularly had young boys sleep over at his apartment. In a deposition, Father Stephen Lynch admitted that he had seen Serrano inappropriately embrace an 8- or 9-year-old boy and kiss him on the lips.  These were egregious incidences of sexual abuse,  attorney Ben Rabinowitz tells the New York Post.  And this all happened after the priests were taught to recognize the signs of abuse.",

The state's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that some 20,667 people accused of drunk driving could have their cases tossed because of Sgt. Marc Dennis, who allegedly failed to perform a temperature check while calibrating machines used to check blood-alcohol levels, NJ.com reports. The ruling means that test results from five of New Jersey's 21 counties\u2014Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, and Union\u2014are inadmissible as evidence if they involve  Alcotest  machines that Dennis handled. A criminal case against the officer, who denies wrongdoing, is still pending. It's not clear how many convictions will actually be vacated\u2014some defendants will have been found not guilty, while others could have been convicted on other evidence. State authorities told the top court that the step Dennis allegedly skipped is only required in New Jersey, the AP reports. The judges ordered the state to notify people who could seek to have DWI convictions vacated because of the ruling, though lawyer Matthew W. Reisig predicts a  hornets' nest  lies ahead in the courts.  The state at some point is going to notify people, but we don\u2019t know if they are notifying the correct people,  he tells the New York Times.

Royal Caribbean International says its Empress of the Seas cruise ship rescued the two men Friday night after it spotted a signal light from their small vessel between Grand Cayman Island and Jamaica, CNN reports. The men told rescuers that strong winds had blown their boat away from its position after they set their nets and fell asleep. They ran out of fuel trying to get back. They managed to fish for food but were severely low on fresh water, having only brought enough for seven days. One of the men was too weak to walk when help arrived. The men were brought to Jamaica for medical attention and crew members gave them $300 to buy food and clothes after they were released from a hospital. The cruise line says the rescue was  even more remarkable  because the ship was not meant to be in the area at the time, NBC News reports. It was originally bound for Cuba but changed course to Ocho Rios, Jamaica after a huge storm in the area last week.  Pure luck, aligning of the stars, God, whatever you choose to believe, the facts are we would NOT have been in that area at the time had we not switched to go to Ocho Rios,  says James Van Fleet, the cruise line's chief meteorologist, who tweeted photos of the rescue.

Well, more than some: It has at least 3,100 signatures\u2014not quite 5% of the workforce\u2014and implores Pichai to withdraw the company from Project Maven. That's a Pentagon program focused on using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, and the New York Times reports it could increase the precision of drone strikes. The Times sees this fight as a sort of bellwether for what's to come as AI advances developed in Silicon Valley are more frequently put to use by the military.  We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,  states what Fast Company calls a  fiery  letter. The employees write that they want the company to turn that sentiment into policy by pledging to never  build warfare technology.  Though Google says the company's role in Project Maven is limited to  non-offensive purposes,  the letter states that  the technology is being built for the military, and once it\u2019s delivered it could easily be used to assist in  tasks like launching weapons. The Times makes the argument that the publicity around the contract\u2014first revealed in March by Gizmodo\u2014could hamper Google when it comes to the ultra-competitive recruitment of AI researchers, who might find the military connection off-putting. That said, Amazon and Microsoft also have Pentagon contracts, but the letter-signers write that those companies' military work  doesn't make this any less risky for Google. Google's unique history, its motto Don\u2019t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.  (AI researchers make  startling  salaries.)",

Although the weather has cleared, more rains are forecast for Monday, threatening to bring further misery to over 100,000 people displaced in western and southern regions of the island nation that were lashed by two days of torrential rains. Taking advantage of a lull in rain, soldiers cleared road access to most of the affected areas while others were reachable by boat, said Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe, who is heading the search and rescue mission. People waded in knee-deep floodwaters to get to army trucks transporting relief supplies and taking away those waiting to be evacuated. Ranasinghe said he didn't expect to find any more survivors. Health minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathna said 102,218 displaced people were being sheltered in 339 relief centers. Special medical teams have been sent to the affected areas, while medicine has been sent by air to hospitals for which access has been cut off, he said. Access roads are still blocked in some areas due to flooding, and fuel shortages have been reported, Senarathna said. The UN said it was assisting in relief efforts in response to a government appeal. It also promised to donate water purification tablets, tents, and other supplies for the displaced. India sent a shipload of goods, while the United States and Pakistan also promised to send relief supplies. Sri Lanka's Department of Meteorology warned that heavy downpours were expected in some of the affected areas.",

Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a new timeline Monday of the deadly ambush, the Wall Street Journal reports.  This is a very complex situation that they found themselves in, and a pretty tough firefight,  Dunford said. Four American troops and five Nigerien soldiers were killed Oct. 4 when they were ambushed by around 50 militants armed with machine guns and rockets. Dunford told reporters that it was an hour before American troops called for help from nearby French forces, and another hour after that before French Mirage jet fighters arrived at the scene near the border with Mali. For reasons that Dunford says are unclear, the French jets didn't initially attack the militants, though French helicopters and Nigerien reinforcements joined the fight later in the day. The slain Americans were part of a group of 12 US troops and 30 Nigeriens on a routine patrol to the remote village of Tongo Tongo, the Washington Post reports. They were ambushed after leaving the village, having spent the night there. Dunford said the investigation will look into whether their objective changed at some point, whether they had adequate communications, and why the body of Sgt. La David Johnson wasn't recovered for two days. The military is also believed to be investigating whether villagers delayed troops' departure to give militants time to set up the ambush.

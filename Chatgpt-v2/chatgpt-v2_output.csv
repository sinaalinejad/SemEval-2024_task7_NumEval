"(Jan 4, 2012  7:54 AM) Scientists say there's a simple way to minimize the risk that the natural gas extraction technique known as  fracking  will cause earthquakes--like the one that hit Ohio on New Year's. But there's a catch: It costs $10 million per injection well, a price the energy industry isn't likely to pony up gladly, Reuters reports. It's not the actual fracking, but the disposal of contaminated fluids--which are typically pumped deep into the Earth--that seems to be causing the quakes. So seismologists say that if companies conducted a thorough seismic survey before pumping drilling fluid into the ground, they could make sure it's not going to hit quake-prone areas. But the process is both more costly and more involved than the oil companies' usual method of drilling a bore hole to collect a limited rock sample, and companies aren't likely to do more until the link between fracking and earthquakes is definitively proven. It hasn't been yet, but the evidence is strong: Every region where fracking has taken off has seen quakes increase tenfold.",Fracking Quakes Could Be Avoided ... for $[MASK]M Per Well,10,10,Copy(10),"{

"(Mar 5, 2015  3:26 PM) You've probably heard the song-- I Fought the Law --but maybe not the story of the singer who made it famous in 1966. Bobby Fuller had just struck it big with his cover of the song when his body was found in a parked car. The 23-year-old had died of asphyxiation, his body doused in gasoline and seemingly beaten, recounts the Los Angeles Times; he reportedly died due to inhaled gasoline. It was officially ruled a suicide, and now a new biography of Fuller co-written by his brother revisits the case, which the LAT calls  one of rock's strangest deaths.  Randy Fuller, who played in Bobby's band, never believed the suicide story, and few others who knew him well did, either. The LAT says various theories, including one involving the mob, have surfaced over the ensuing decades without verification. ( Who would pour gas on himself in a hot car?  Randy Fuller said in 1998.  I just think he got in a bad situation that night, met the wrong dude and couldn't get out of it. ) The book, I Fought The Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller apparently doesn't try to solve the mystery as much as resurrect it. Fuller died just a few months after recording his big hit, notes LA Magazine.

"(May 6, 2020  6:21 AM CDT) Anthony Fauci is literally the stuff romance novels are made of. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was the inspiration for the erotic hero in Sally Quinn's 1991 novel Happy Endings, in which widowed First Lady Sadie Grey falls for a sandy-haired NIH scientist named Michael Lanzer, who has just discovered a therapy for AIDS. Quinn had been seated next to Fauci, who was then battling the spread of AIDS, at a Washington dinner party as she sought inspiration for the sequel to 1986's Regrets Only, per the Washingtonian.  Usually those dinners, you make polite conversation, and that's it. But we had this intense conversation, personal conversation. I thought, 'Wow, this guy is amazing,'  Quinn tells the outlet.  I just fell in love with him.  She decided Grey should  fall in love with this doctor who does this amazing work, and doesn't get a lot of publicity,  somebody  really brilliant, and compassionate, and kind, and decent, and honest ...and sexy.  The novel finds Grey musing over Lanzer's  low, melodious, sexy, almost hypnotic  voice. Upon being dragged to a White House event, Lanzer complains about becoming a  PR man,  but he supports the administration even as  an incapacitated president leaves the nation feeling 'rudderless'  and  a senior official spews reckless claims about HIV,  per the Washingtonian. Quinn says Fauci has known about the inspiration for some time.  He just thought it was funny,  she says.  I think he was a little embarrassed.

The poacher, Felix Byamukama, had been part a group hunting illegally for bush meat in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Byamukama. who said he killed the 25-year-old gorilla with a spear in self-defense after it charged him, was sentenced to 11 years after pleading guilty to illegally entering the park and killing the gorilla, along with a bush pig and a small antelope, the BBC reports. Three other members of the hunting party are in jail but have yet to be tried.  We are relieved that Rafiki has received justice and this should serve as an example to other people who kill wildlife,  said Sam Mwandha, executive director of the Uganda Wildlife Authority, per CNN.  If one person kills wildlife, we all lose, therefore we request every person to support our efforts of conserving wildlife.  The wildlife authority says Byamukama could have received a life sentence if he had been tried by a special wildlife court.

He had slimmed down to around 867 pounds in recent years but remained bedridden at his mother's home in Monterrey. Officials say he was taken to the hospital--by crane--earlier this month because of an abnormal heartbeat. Uribe made the news in 2008, when he got married for the second time. He left the house--but not his bed--for the ceremony, which he was transported to in a flatbed truck. He got married for the first time in 1987, when he was living in Dallas and selling tacos on a street corner, Fox reports.

"(Sep 22, 2013  6:53 AM CDT) We are a couple of weeks away from getting our newly designed $100 bills, and when they arrive on October 8, some will actually be worth $1000 ... or more. No, the government isn't slipping in an extra zero. But it is including, as always, an eight-digit serial number. And as the Boston Globe explains, currency collectors will pay big if the numbers are  fancy.  That's the collectors' term, not the Globe's, for serial numbers that fall in a number of categories: there are  low  (00000001 through 00000100),  ladders  (43210987),  radar' (43788734),  solids  (33333333), and  repeaters  (82118211). Then there are random ones: 31415927 (pi) or 07041776 (read that as 07/04/1776). The low number ones are among the most valuable, with new $100 bills with 00000001 expected to sell for as much as $15000. (Before the serial number you'll see one or two letters; these indicate which Federal Reserve bank issued it. As such, there can be more than one bill in any denomination with the same serial number in a given year.) So how do you get your hands on one? It helps if you have friends in high and very secure places. Bank employees, especially vault workers, are typically able to swap out a normal bill for a fancy one, says the director of currency of a Dallas auction house, and since bricks of money are marked with the serial number range, they can spot the bills fairly easily.

With the encouragement of employees at the Tennessee facility where she resides, Holt, who will turn 101 on Dec. 13, entered and won the  Wish of a Lifetime  contest held by her center's parent company. Her prize: a three-night stay in a beachfront room along the Gulf of Mexico in Orange Beach, Ala., AL.com reports. Holt made the six-hour trip there earlier this week to start realizing her dream: She has eaten seafood on the shore, watched dolphins and pelicans frolic in the water, explored the beach in a wheelchair equipped with heavy-duty sand wheels, and dipped her feet in the Gulf. The mayor of Orange Beach even came by to present her with a special plaque and gift bag.

The boy began vomiting the next day, then developed a droop on the left side of his face on the flight home and soon couldn't walk, reports Eureka Alerts. The doctors say that while several cases of stroke resulting from roller-coaster rides have been documented in adults, this is the youngest known case--in fact, they've identified only two other pediatric cases in medical literature, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a  hypermobility  that makes them more vulnerable to such tears,  albeit rarely.  Six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports CBS News.

"(Aug 10, 2015  1:40 PM CDT)  To smoke or not to smoke  was not the question. Something had been smoked in the pipe bowls and stems unearthed from William Shakespeare' garden in Stratford-upon-Avon; the question was what. Researchers in South Africa now have gas chromatography mass spectrometry to thank for their answer. A piece in the Conversation based on the report published in the South African Journal of Science explains the  technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago.  Eight of the 24 pipe-fragment samples tested were shown to contain cannabis; another had evidence of nicotine, and two more  evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves.  Of those, only four of the cannabis samples were from Shakespeare's garden; the others were from the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Study author Francis Thackeray writes that the research establishes that a wide range of plants were smoked in the area during the early 17th century, and he leans on Shakespeare's own words to try to draw connections. Thackeray references Sonnet 76, which refers to  invention in a noted weed ; he interprets weed as cannabis and invention as writing. As for whether we can conclude that Shakespeare got high, Thackeray writes  one can well imagine  it.

The group says the Treasury plan is progress, but they're also not thrilled about the fact that the yet-to-be-chosen woman may have to share the bill with Hamilton.  We would love to see a woman not have to share her glory, and her opportunity to be recognized and honored,  Executive Director Susan Ades Stone tells USA Today. And--unlike Jackson-- Alexander Hamilton is not someone that people have a problem with.  Stone tells the New Yorker that the group focused on the $20 partly because of the reputation of Jackson, who was responsible for the brutal expulsion of many Native Americans from their lands--and was strongly opposed to central banking.  We'll still have to be looking at Andrew Jackson for quite a bit longer, and that's a shame,  says Stone, who hopes Treasury chief Jack Lew takes into account the fact that Harriet Tubman won the group's poll for the new face on the $20.

The state reports voting has topped 9 million, a record, as of Thursday; in 2016, 8969226 ballots were cast. The votes cast represent 53% of registered voters. Voters don't indicate party membership when they register in Texas, per the Texas Tribune, so the high turnout doesn't indicate support for one side or the other. But it would seem to show that voters are motivated. In addition, Gov. Greg Abbott ordered six bonus days of early voting in an effort to keep crowds down at polls on Election Day. And leaders of both parties called on voters to act early.

"(Jun 2, 2011  11:57 AM CDT) Surprise, surprise: Mitt Romney is officially a candidate for president in 2012. He launched his campaign this afternoon with a speech that went after President Obama on the economy, reports the Boston Globe. The big line getting play:  When Barack Obama came to office, we wished him well and hoped for the best. Now, in the third year of his four-year term, we have more than promises and slogans to go by. Barack Obama has failed America.  He also suggested Obama thought more like a European than an American--four separate times. New York's Daily Intel rounds up the lines here. On another front, Romney took another stab at distancing Romneycare from Obamacare by repeating his demand that the federal plan be repealed so states can figure out their own solutions.

Nikias left his post in August 2018, after a scandal involving a school gynecologist, in which he and other administrators were accused of not acting on abuse complaints over decades against Dr. George Tyndall. A USA Today analysis shows Nikias, who had lived on campus in the president's house, received a $3 million, no-interest housing loan as part of his deal when he stepped down. His take averaged more than $2 million over the previous four years. Nikias' final check, USC said,  reflects money owed to him for salary, retirement and other benefits, some of which date back to the employment agreement he entered into when he became President in 2010.  The university's Board of Regents said it went along with the package for Nikias  to accelerate his departure.  Nikias, who had no direct involvement in the scandal, is still a USC faculty member, per USA Today.

Police say Anna Blessing told them she had been contemplating her 72-year-old son's plans to put her in assisted living for several days before she confronted him in his bedroom Monday morning with two pistols concealed in her robe, Fox News reports. According to a Maricopa County Sheriff's Office press release, Blessing told officers that she  fired multiple rounds striking and killing her son.

Police say that Blessing told them she thought about killing herself after the girlfriend left the room, but she lacked the weapons to do so, the Arizona Republic reports. She told police that her son wanted her to leave the Fountain Hills home because she had become  difficult to live with.  She reportedly said she told her son:  You took my life, so I'm taking yours.  Blessing has been charged with first-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and kidnapping.

"(Apr 9, 2017  12:49 PM CDT) The Oregon Legislature may have an unusual request for voters in the next election that harkens back to that fateful day in 1804 when a bitter rivalry between Vice President Aaron Burr and the nation's first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, was settled with a fatal gunshot. Should ongoing discussions in Salem materialize, voters would see a question on their general-election ballots asking if a 172-year-old ban on dueling by public officials--as in, the old-fashioned way of resolving fights--should be erased from the Oregon Constitution, reports the AP. The constitutional ban in question is Article II, Section 9, which says anyone who offers, accepts, participates in a  challenge to fight a duel ... or who shall agree to go out of the State to fight a duel, shall be ineligible to any office of trust, or profit.  The article was signed in 1845, almost 15 years before Oregon's statehood, when squabbles were still often resolved by duel even decades after Hamilton's death.  They decided that it would not be very civil if two members of the Legislature disagreed and then shot each other on the front steps of the provisional capitol,  GOP Sen. Brian Boquist said Wednesday during the bill's first committee hearing. Democratic Sen. Ginny Burdick jokingly called it  the bill I've been waiting all session for.  The sole public testimony came from Dan Meek, a Oregon Progressive Party rep, who opposes Boquist's proposal.  This resolution would allow the candidacies of persons who give or accept challenges to fight duels,  Meek wrote.  Also, there is a cost to removing obviously unenforced and unenforceable provisions in the Oregon Constitution, including the cost of processing and printing this resolution on millions of ballots and processing the results.",Oregon May Ditch Its [MASK]-Year-Old Ban on Dueling,172,172,Copy(172),"{""ans"": ""172""}"

The men were also charged with creating false footage suggesting the country was facing a civil war, the AP reports. Australian Peter Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy, and Egyptian Baher Mohammed had been reporting on protesters backing ousted president Mohamed Morsi and were detained in a December raid on their Cairo hotel room. The trio has been housed in a 13-foot cell for 23 hours a day since, the BBC reports. The prosecution's case was thin: It showed video obtained from the journalists covering a veterinary hospital and Christian life, photos from Greste's family vacation, a news report made while the trio wasn't in the country, and a pop video by the Australian singer Gotye, notes al-Jazeera. (As the New York Times reports,  There was no publicly available evidence that the journalists had either supported the Brotherhood or broadcast anything inaccurate. )  We are deeply concerned that this verdict is part of a broader attempt to muzzle media freedoms,  says Australia's foreign minister.

The Hill reports that spectators were shocked when the notoriously silent justice asked a question--and a follow-up-- during an argument on racial discrimination in jury selection. The court was hearing the case of Curtis Flowers, who was sentenced to death in his sixth trial for four 1996 murders in Mississippi. His lawyers say a prosecutor unjustly dismissed black jurors, but in his first question in three years, Thomas took the argument in a different direction and asked if Flowers' defense team had struck any jurors, the Washington Post reports. When attorney Sheri Lynn Johnson said they had, Thomas asked what race they were. Flowers' attorney told Thomas that the jurors excluded had been white, but added that the question before the court was the motivation of prosecutor Doug Evans, not Flowers. Thomas last asked a question from the bench in 2016, and three years isn't that long an interval for him: Before the 2016 question, he had been silent for more than a decade.

Craig Venter, the geneticist who created synthetic life, is pairing up with stem cell leader Dr. Robert Hariri and Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize Foundation; their Human Longevity Inc. has set its initial sights on cancer, but also intends to initially focus on the likes of diabetes, dementia, heart disease, and liver disease in an effort to keep adults healthy as they get older--for as long as possible.  Our goal is to make 100 years old the new 60,  says Diamandis, according to Businessweek. Adds Venter, according to the New York Times,  Your age is your No. 1 risk factor for almost every disease, but it's not a disease itself.  At the root of the new venture will be what Venter touts as the world's biggest human DNA sequencing operation; the group has already bought two uber-high-tech HiSeq X Ten gene sequencing systems from Illumina, which has provided a healthy share of Human Longevity's $70 million in funding. The systems will allow the group to sequence 40000 human genomes a year, from the young and healthy to the old and ill, Reuters reports. Ultimately, the company hopes to sequence 100000 human genomes per year. Combined with information on each person (medical records, genetic data from their microbes, the chemicals in their bloodstream), they hope to gain a better understanding of how to prevent disease, and in turn lower the cost of medication by offering people potentially more effective medication designed for their genetic profile, USA Today reports.

One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States, maybe it's true here as well,  he said, per the Guardian,  is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be' and then we start sometimes creating what's called a 'circular firing squad,' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.

"(Dec 6, 2016  12:03 PM) Apple tried to hold onto the full $548 million in damages it recouped from Samsung in a lawsuit over smartphone design patents, but it looks like it may now have to settle for much less, based on a Tuesday Supreme Court decision, the Hill reports. The ruling noted that even though Apple's 2011 complaint accused Samsung of ripping off the look of the iPhone for its own devices (including the  rectangular front face with rounded edges ), as well as how the grid that shows app icons is presented, Apple couldn't collect on damages on total profits Samsung took in for its phones overall (Apple had originally been awarded more than $1 billion by a jury in 2012, but that number was whittled down.) And it all came down to three words, per Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the court's 8-0 opinion, per Reuters, which notes the high court almost never hears design patent cases. According to Section 289 of the US Patent Act, the  article of manufacture  term used in patent law is meant to cover both the entire product that a consumer can buy, as well as individual elements, or components, of that product. The ruling points out that when an item is just one component (e.g., a dinner plate), it's easy to apply this law, but for a multi-component item such as a smartphone, it becomes trickier. The Supreme Court disagreed with the appeals court's ruling that the smartphone as a whole was the only way  article of manufacture  could be interpreted, instead deciding that design infringement (and therefore damages) could be parsed into separate components. The Supreme Court's decision overturned the appeals court's ruling for $399 million awarded to Apple, but Fortune notes the case is now being sent back to the lower court to decide how much Apple's patents really merit.

"(Mar 20, 2014  4:10 PM CDT) Prior to today, the official scientific answer to the question,  How many scents can the human nose detect?  was a measly 10000. But now, thanks to a new study in Science, the answer is 1 trillion, give or take. Researchers had long assumed that the first number, based on relatively rudimentary tests in the 1920s, was way off the mark, and the new study is the first significant one to apply modern methods to revise it, reports Nature. The 1 trillion figure is seen as an average, with some people able to detect as  few  as 80 million odors and others able to pick up on a mind-boggling  thousand trillion  of them, according to the scientists' extrapolations.  Ten thousand is kind of pathetic--it's a pretty low number,  says molecular neurobiologist Leslie Voshall of the Rockefeller University, a co-author of the study.  It led to the idea that humans have a comparatively low sense of smell.  For their experiment, the scientists used  a procedure similar to a hearing exam, in which listeners must try to distinguish between two tones,  explains the Washington Post. Researchers combined 128 different odor molecules to create composite scents of varying complexity, then ran them by 26 test subjects. Participants got three vials--two had identical odors and the third was slightly different--and had to pick the odd one out, reports NPR. The analysis gets more complicated than that, but after hundreds of experiments on each subject, researchers extrapolated the results to arrive at the 1 trillion average. The study is being well received in the field.  Their work confirms that smell is an incredibly rich, variable, and nuanced medium,  says one olfactory scientist not involved with the research.

The issue, as it was in West Virginia, is money, though the particulars vary. In Kentucky, teachers are marching over the state budget and a surprise pension bill that lawmakers unexpectedly shoehorned into a sewage bill last week. In Oklahoma, the issue revolves around teacher salaries--an Oklahoma Education Association rep says teachers are looking for a $10000 pay hike over three years--and funding for education overall.

"(Apr 16, 2018  11:32 AM CDT) In the summer of 2015, Allegiant Air had a number of in-flight breakdowns--on one day in particular, there were five such problems. Between the beginning of 2016 and the end of October 2017, a 60 Minutes investigation uncovered more than 100 serious mechanical incidents the airline experienced: from hydraulic leaks and air pressure loss in the cabin to rapid descents, aborted takeoffs, and more--including 60 unscheduled landings. The airline has just 99 planes, yet experienced 25 engine failures or malfunctions in two years, and its planes are three and a half times more likely than those of other carriers to experience  serious in-flight mechanical failures,  per the report. But Allegiant Air, a budget carrier based in Las Vegas, is one of the most profitable airlines in the US, even if most customers are unaware of those problems. A former member of the National Transportation Safety Board says he won't fly the airline and encourages his family and friends not to fly it, either. The aviation experts 60 Minutes spoke to during its 7-month investigation believe the problems stem from Allegiant's ultra-low-cost fares; in order to keep them so affordable, the airline must keep its own costs down--and keep its planes flying as long as possible. Almost 30% of its planes are McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s, which are old and difficult to find parts for. Those planes, nearly all of which were bought secondhand from foreign airlines, are responsible for most of the problems the investigation uncovered. Some also fault the FAA for being too lax in its oversight of the airline. Allegiant is calling the story a  false narrative,  while the AP reports shares of its parent company were down in early trading.

"(Feb 27, 2015  8:24 AM) Sleeping more than eight hours a night? That may be too much of a good thing, because you're more likely to suffer a stroke, according to a study out of the University of Cambridge. Researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 10000 people ages 42 to 81 in the UK, and they report in the journal Neurology that based on nearly a decade of follow-up and 346 reported strokes, older adults who sleep more than eight hours a night are 46% more likely to suffer a stroke than adults who slept six to eight hours. That risk is actually four times greater when people went from sleeping for less than six hours at the beginning of the study to more than 8 as the years passed, per a Eureka Alert press release. The researchers adjusted for several factors, including age and sex, and their findings were strikingly consistent with what they found in a review of the combined data of 11 similar studies spanning 560000 people in seven countries. But in terms of age and sex, the Los Angeles Times notes the following: The link between the risk and sleep length was a little stronger for women, and the increased stroke risk was only seen in those eight-plus-hours sleepers who were 63 or older. The researchers caution that it remains unclear whether longer sleep duration is a symptom or cause of stroke risk.

"(Oct 14, 2013  2:59 AM CDT) Some 15 years after tobacco companies agreed to cough up billions of dollars in fines to settle health-care lawsuits nationwide, the details on how state governments have used the cash are pretty hazy, NPR finds. More than $100 billion has been paid out so far, with more than $100 billion yet to come, but while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that at least 14% of the cash go toward anti-smoking programs, experts say it has been hard to persuade state governments to spend much on smoking prevention and most of the cash has been spent elsewhere.  What states have actually done has fluctuated year by year ... but it's never come close to 14%,  says a tobacco industry analyst.  There are some fairly notorious cases of money being used for fixing potholes, for tax relief, [and] for financial assistance for tobacco farmers.  Despite the lack of spending, smoking rates have dropped by around a quarter in the 15 years since the landmark settlement--but Big Tobacco hasn't exactly struggled financially.  When you are supplying the most widely used addictive product in the world, you have certain advantages,  says the analyst.

"(Sep 8, 2016  5:00 PM CDT) An  exciting art world jigsaw puzzle  is nearly complete after the third piece of a painting by Belgian artist Rene Magritte missing for more than 80 years was recently discovered hiding at the Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery in Britain, the Guardian reports. Magritte's The Enchanted Pose was part of a 1927 exhibition, but no one purchased it, and it was returned to Magritte. Since 1932, its whereabouts have been unknown, leaving behind only a single black-and-white photograph as evidence. In 2013, two pieces of The Enchanted Pose--which shows two nude women standing next to each other--were discovered hidden beneath other Magritte paintings in the US and Sweden. The discovery of the third piece, the lower right corner, was announced Thursday. The new piece of The Enchanted Pose was discovered by art conservator Alice Tavares da Silva, who was inspecting a Magritte painting called The Human Condition before it was loaned out to another museum. She discovered paint on the side of the canvas under the frame that didn't match the painting itself. Artnet News reports it's rare for a Magritte work to have paint on the edges. An X-ray of The Human Condition revealed it was painted over a piece of The Enchanted Pose. Tavares da Silva calls it a  hugely exciting discovery.  According to the Norfolk Eastern Daily Press, it now appears Magritte cut The Enchanted Pose into four equal pieces for unknown reasons, then painted over them. But there's still one piece of the puzzle missing. (A Degas painting panned as discolored hid secret image.)",Art World Has Nearly Solved [MASK]-Year-Old Jigsaw Puzzle,80,80,Copy(80),"{

In a Des Moines Register column, the former governor of Maryland says he hopes the former Democratic congressman who staged a  courageous run for US Senate in Texas  last year, ultimately losing to incumbent Ted Cruz, runs for the White House. Back in 2016,  America wasn't in the mood for new leadership. We were in a mood of anger, rage and retribution. And in this mood, Donald Trump's candidacy rose,  O'Malley writes. But now, things have changed:  People are looking for a new leader who can bring us together.  He recounts the two years he spent campaigning with more than 120 Democratic candidates in more than 30 states at every level of government and his finding that  voters were clearly longing for new leadership.  It's impressive that O'Rourke came so close to beating Cruz in Texas, and O'Malley believes the country would embrace O'Rourke if he were to run for president.  Because he is of a new generation, O'Rourke understands that a new way of governing--with openness, transparency, and performance--is called for to tackle our problems in the Information Age,  O'Malley writes.

The case goes back to 1982, when somebody shot to death Marilyn Green and fiance Jerry Hillard. Prosecutors first convicted Anthony Porter, who ended up on death row. But 48 hours before he was to die, his conviction got thrown out, thanks to the work of Northwestern University's Medill Innocence Project.

After making a stop for a few hours at a British station on the edge of Antarctica, the two workers were flown to the southernmost Chilean city of Punta Arenas, the National Science Foundation said in a statement published on its Facebook page. In a hectic two days of flying, the rescue team flew 3000 miles round-trip from the British station Rothera to pick up the workers at the US Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole, the AP reports.  From Punta Arenas, the two patients aboard will be transported to a medical facility that can provide a level of care that is not available at Amundsen-Scott,  the National Science Foundation says. The NSF has not identified the sick workers or their conditions, citing medical privacy. They both work for contractor Lockheed Martin.

The standoff began about 11am PDT Saturday when the bus was stopped on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Cosmopolitan hotel-casino.  He was just contained to that location. He never exited the bus,  Clark County's assistant sheriff said. Two people were taken to the hospital, reports the AP. One died, and the other was in fair condition. For hours, crisis negotiators, robots, and armored vehicles surrounded the bus with authorities uncertain if there were any more victims inside. Meanwhile, officers swept into casinos to warn tourists to bunker down, leaving these normally bustling pedestrian areas and a road notorious for taxi-to-taxi traffic empty. Some in the Cosmopolitan--guests out on their balconies, people on the pool deck--saw the tense situation unfold below. Former NBA player Scot Pollard was at a bar at the Cosmopolitan around 11am when he saw several people, including staff, running through the area toward the casino and screaming  get out of the way.  After he was told that the area would be closed, he went back to his room, which oversees the Strip.  We can hear them negotiating. We can hear them saying things like 'No one else needs to get hurt,' 'Come out with your hands up. We are not going anywhere,'   he said. A police officer said just before 3:30pm that the man, who had a handgun, surrendered without incident. Police did not open fire and said the man is the only suspect.

"(Mar 13, 2017  11:52 AM CDT) Two former Penn State University administrators pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanor child endangerment for their roles in the Jerry Sandusky child molestation case, reports the AP, more than five years after the scandal engulfed the school. Former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz originally were charged with felonies. The reduced charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Penn State ex-President Graham Spanier was also charged; his prosecution appears to be moving forward, with jury selection set for next week. The three handled a 2001 complaint by a graduate assistant who said he saw Sandusky, a retired defensive football coach, sexually abusing a boy in a team shower. They did not report the matter to police or child welfare authorities, but barred Sandusky from bringing children to campus. Sandusky was not arrested until a decade later. He was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse of 10 boys, and is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison term. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest, Paterno was fired. Schultz and Curley were arrested in 2011, and Spanier in 2012. The three former administrators at Penn State had also faced conspiracy charges. Each felony count carried the possibility of seven years in prison. Their case has dragged on for years because of a dispute about their representation during a grand jury appearance by Penn State's then-chief counsel Cynthia Baldwin. That legal fight prompted the Superior Court decision that threw out several charges, including perjury and obstruction.

The US has lately shifted its attention away from the region--one of Afghanistan's most violent since 2005--concentrating instead on population centers. The assault took place near Pakistan's tribal areas, over which its government has little sway. Last summer, the same battalion killed some 150 fighters in the region; afterward, the US attempted to build an Afghan police station there.

"(Mar 14, 2018  4:03 PM CDT) Todd Entrekin makes just under $95000 a year as the sheriff of Alabama's Etowah County, but somehow he and his wife Karen (an ex-probation officer) have $1.7 million in property spread over two counties. AL.com reports that how he paid for all of this is now being called into question due to some ethics disclosure paperwork he recently filed with the state, in which he noted he has received more than $750000 in  compensation  over the past three years from a  Food Provisions  account--namely, funds offered by federal, state, and municipal governments to feed prisoners in the Etowah County Jail. And Entrekin says it's completely legal, based on an antiquated state law passed before World War II that apparently allows sheriffs to keep  excess  funds meant to feed prisoners. AL.com says the state law is  likely  being exploited by other Alabama sheriffs as well. However, other counties that end up with a surplus give the money to the county government so it can be put to use elsewhere instead of lining the sheriffs' pockets.  I believe the funds belong to the taxpayers and any excess funds should go toward things that benefit the taxpayer,  the police chief of Rainbow City, who used to work under the former Etowah County sheriff, says.  There's been a tremendous amount of money left over that shouldn't be used as a bonus check.  Two advocacy groups filed suit in January against 49 Alabama sheriffs who won't show financials around their prison feeding programs. In Etowah County's case, AL.com is also probing county contracts awarded to companies that have donated to Entrekin campaigns.

According to court records, Llivaganay was charged with 15 counts of petty larceny and pleaded guilty in July. He is due to be sentenced later this month.

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a new timeline Monday of the deadly ambush, the Wall Street Journal reports.  This is a very complex situation that they found themselves in, and a pretty tough firefight,  Dunford said. Four American troops and five Nigerien soldiers were killed Oct. 4 when they were ambushed by around 50 militants armed with machine guns and rockets. Dunford told reporters that it was an hour before American troops called for help from nearby French forces, and another hour after that before French Mirage jet fighters arrived at the scene near the border with Mali. For reasons that Dunford says are unclear, the French jets didn't initially attack the militants, though French helicopters and Nigerien reinforcements joined the fight later in the day. The slain Americans were part of a group of 12 US troops and 30 Nigeriens on a routine patrol to the remote village of Tongo Tongo, the Washington Post reports. They were ambushed after leaving the village, having spent the night there. Dunford said the investigation will look into whether their objective changed at some point, whether they had adequate communications, and why the body of Sgt. La David Johnson wasn't recovered for two days. The military is also believed to be investigating whether villagers delayed troops' departure to give militants time to set up the ambush.

After the victims sued, the diocese argued that it shouldn't be held responsible for the abuse because Serrano was officially a volunteer, not an employee, even though he received a stipend from the church, the New York Times reports. A judge, however, found that priests and parish workers ignored signs of abuse, including the fact that Serrano regularly had young boys sleep over at his apartment. In a deposition, Father Stephen Lynch admitted that he had seen Serrano inappropriately embrace an 8- or 9-year-old boy and kiss him on the lips.

Nurses and midwives met with her along the way, and before giving birth to son Earl Reese-Thornton Jr. on Dec. 2, 2013, things had been progressing well. The birth, she alleged in a lawsuit, was disastrous. Earl Jr. had to be revived after entering the world and suffered permanent severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The judge agreed Dr. Ata Atogho was at fault, with the verdict noting he left her room for extended spells, once to speak to his stockbroker for eight minutes; with fetal heart rate monitors indicating the baby was in severe distress, the doctor also should have performed a C-section but didn't. The $33.8 million Dixon and her child will receive as a result won't cost Atogho a penny. That's because he wasn't the one being sued; rather, the US government was, as it's liable for any injuries its medical employees cause, explains the Miami Herald. Not only does Dixon say Atogho never apologized, she also says he lied, something backed up by the testimony of a nurse who noted Atogho wrote  refused c/s  [that's C-section] in Dixon's medical records; on the contrary, the nurse testified she yelled,  Just cut me.  Local 10 reports the judge in his order cited a defense expert who says the child will live only nine to 12 more years. Though the head of Jessie Trice says Atogho is no longer connected to its centers, he has not been reprimanded and his Florida medical license is currently  clear and active.
